<h2 id="BISHOP_POTTER">INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p>These “Notes” need no introduction. They were
jotted down, from day to day, as a private journal,
and are printed only at the instance of friends.
The undersigned greatly mistakes if they are not
welcomed as an accession to our literature. On
every page they betray a large and elegant culture,
and what is better, they manifest a profound sympathy
in all that is human, and a keen insight into
nature and into man’s heart. Felicities of thought
and expression abound, vivid pictures of incidents
and life-like sketches of character. They are full
of spirit, of wisdom, and of right feeling.</p>

<p>They rise, too, to the level of a great subject.
In the conflict which convulses our land, how
many souls are stirred&mdash;how many hearts made
to burn! We cannot envy him or her who can
look on such a scene&mdash;on the principles involved,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
and the interests at stake, and yet not feel kindled
to a higher life. We can regard but with compassion
those who see in this war only blunders to be
criticised, absurdities to be ridiculed, crimes to be
gloated over, or life and property to be deplored.</p>

<p>If, in the liberty and peace of those who live in
this land, and of the millions who are to come
after, there be anything precious; if there is anything
sacred and venerable in the unity of a great
people and in the sovereignty with which they
have been charged by solemn compact; if there
is any claim upon us as men and as Christians,
in behalf of a race that has suffered long and
sorely at our hands, and that now, for the first
time, seems to behold the light of hope, then is
there that at stake which should move every one
to sympathy and to help.</p>

<p>Our hearts must bleed as we gaze on the vast
suffering; but “we buy our blessings at a price.”
Hitherto it has been our great danger that we
have had little save sunshine. Prosperity, great
and uninterrupted, is perilous for nations as
well as individuals. It is amidst thunder-clouds,
and storms, that the oak gets strength and deep
root; it is while battling in tempestuous seas that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
the vessel proves and at the same time confirms
her capacity. So in this gigantic strife, powers
will be elicited, and a trust in God and in grand
principles developed, which will be, we trust, our
fortress and our high tower hereafter.</p>

<p>It is one of the merits of this writer that, with
a heart alive to the wants and wretchedness of
the sick and wounded, she joins discernment of
the mighty questions involved. She sees, with
exquisite relish, the picturesque in character and
incident; she has an eye, too, for the deep wealth
of affection and generous sympathy that lie embedded
in the roughest natures&mdash;for the flashes
of merriment and drollery which lighten up the
darkest scenes&mdash;for the delicate tastes and noble
sentiments that often possess those whose hands
have been hardened by toil, and whose minds (in
the judgment of too many) must needs have been
debased by habitual contact with vulgar pursuits.
Hers is a heart which can feel that which makes
all the world akin&mdash;which can see that labor does
not degrade, but rather elevates those who pursue
it in the true spirit; and that nothing can be more
preposterous in a land like ours, which is made
and glorified by the joint handiwork of God and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
man, than to decry or despise it. These pages
are instinct with faith in God and in our people;
with hope for the future; with a charity that
never faileth.</p>

<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>

<p>A literary friend said to me some time since,
“One of the greatest evils of this rebellion, is the
manner in which it is tainting our literature,
science, and arts. If they would only fight it
out and confine it to fighting, bad as it is, we
might rise from its effects; but this flood of war-literature
will so set the mind of the next generation
into a military groove, that poetry, refined
taste, and love for the beautiful, will be lost in
the roar of literary drums and mental musketry.”</p>

<p>“And did you imagine,” said I, “that such a
rebellion could be carried on without affecting
and injuring every nerve and fibre of the whole
country? Do you not see that it is a moral
Pyæmia&mdash;a poisoning of the veins of the entire
nation? And although we trust the disease may
be arrested ere it destroy national existence, still
the system suffers throughout; and the result must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
be vapid volumes, paltry pictures, and silly statements
of so-called science. But granting that it
is to be deplored&mdash;that the military mind should
take the place of the literary one, I must break
a lance with you on the question whether, in so
doing, ‘poetry, refined taste, and love for the
beautiful’ must of necessity be lost. I will not
grant it. At the opening of the war I thought,
with you, that the finer feelings of our nature were
exclusively the property of the higher classes; but
two years’ experience in a military hospital, where
men appear mentally as well as physically in “undress
uniform,” has shown me the utter fallacy of
such a theory; and now I do not hesitate to affirm
that I have seen there as much unwritten poetry,
tender feeling, aye, and love for the beautiful, as I
have ever witnessed among the same number of
people gathered together at any time, or in any
place.”</p>

<p>Sickly sentimentality, whether shown in words
or actions, for “our poor, suffering soldiers,” is certainly
a thing to be much deprecated; but, on the
other hand, is not a hard, gregarious view of them
to be equally avoided?</p>

<p>I do not ask to raise them to <em>more</em>, but not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
sink them to <em>less</em> than men. Our army is no “Corporation
without a soul;” it is a mass of units&mdash;a
collection of beating hearts, throbbing pulses, and
straining nerves, which ask and need our love and
sympathy, and surely they should not ask in vain.</p>

<p>I have anticipated your question, dear reader,
“Why bore us with your conversation with your
friend?” Simply because that conversation has
led to the further bore of this volume. These
notes were jotted down as the incidents occurred;
they are a simple statement of facts simply stated.
The only object of collecting them at present is
that, as my friend’s feeling appears to be a general
one, it seemed possible that these instances might
prove, in some small degree, the converse of the
proposition; and, although at any other time quite
unworthy of publication, the intense and absorbing
desire, at present, to obtain particulars of even the
most trifling circumstances connected with the war,
has led me to hope that they may not be wholly
without interest.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I must regret the necessity of any
mention of self; but the nature of the subject
requires this, and without it, very frequently the
point to be established would be lost. I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
omitted many incidents from this very objection,
but it would be unjust to the cause which I have
at heart to do more, and I must therefore trust
that the reader will believe me, when I say that
any such allusion arises from necessity, not taste.</p>

<h1>NOTES OF HOSPITAL LIFE.</h1>

<h2 id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p>Life in a hospital! When and where? Now and
here. Now, in the year of our Lord one thousand
eight hundred and sixty-three; here, in this good
city of Philadelphia, whose generous outpouring of
her sons, for the cause, nearest all our hearts, can
only be matched by the loving tenderness with
which she receives and cherishes them, on their
return, maimed and mutilated, to their homes
amongst us. Every one, who knows anything of
the subject at the present moment, is well aware,
that no matter where it may be situated, whether
opened at the first need, or the creation of yesterday,
still “our Hospital” will be, to the speaker, the
most perfect in arrangement, discipline, and ventilation;
the medical staff connected with it the
most efficient, skilful and faithful; the corps of subordinates
the most competent, systematic and thorough.
Such is human nature, and we all find the
weakness a pardonable one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>How natural it seems to be here! How naturally
we accept this strange daily life! And yet, how
unnatural it would have seemed two years ago,
could we have lifted but one little corner of that
mystic veil, which so blessedly prevents even a
glimpse of the coming hour; how unnatural, I say,
would it have seemed to us, to be standing, as we
are at the present moment, in a little domain of
our own, consecrated exclusively to us; turning to
all sorts of utterly unwonted avocations; any and
every sort of service which may bring comfort or
aid to those who were strangers to us, till this very
day, and after a few to-morrows, will, in all probability,
be strangers to us forevermore.</p>

<p>And yet, how glad we are to do it, and they to
have it done. “Stop there, my friend,” you say.
“‘And they to have it done.’ Is that so? Are
the men quite as glad to have it done, as you to
do it?” Ah, you have heard that cry. I too have
heard it, and will tell you frankly, and as far as
possible, impartially, my own conclusion, after
careful examination of that point:</p>

<p>“Women are not needed in these hospitals.”</p>

<p>“Depend upon it, ladies are a bore here.”</p>

<p>“The men are victimized.”</p>

<p>All these and many similar remarks have I heard,
and they have led me earnestly to look at the question
in all its bearings. The petty jealousy of man
and his work; the narrowness and littleness of mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
which bristles with indignant anger at the suggestion
of man’s superiority, are all unworthy of the
great cause we have at heart. But one question is
before us. Are the facts so, or are they not? If,
after every effort honestly to get at the truth, it
shall appear that there really is no need of woman
and her work; that these enormous collections of
suffering and dying human beings, massed together
by this ruthless rebellion, with its wretched results,
actually and positively, may be carried on better,
more practically, more systematically, without her
aid and co-operation, then let her promptly and
decidedly retire; let her do it without anger, without
clamor, without bitterness; she is not needed.
If this be so, let her turn into some other channel
the love and tenderness which she longs to lavish
on those who are giving their heart’s blood to
defend and protect her.</p>

<p>If this be so, I say; but if on the other hand it
shall appear that her presence is not productive of
disorder; not distasteful to the men; that she is
not only sanctioned, but welcomed by the authorities
in charge, then let her go “right onward,”
unmindful of coldness, calumny, or comment from
the world outside, strong in the consciousness of
singleness of aim and purity of purpose. And,
more than this, if the Dread Day may show, that
through her kneeling at the bedside of one sinning
soul, through her teaching of</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">the dark Door of Death has been changed into the
White Gate of Life Everlasting, shall it not then
be granted that women were needed?</p>

<p>This is not the time or place to enter upon the
great question of woman’s mission. She has her
work, and the time is coming when she shall be
permitted to do it. God, in His own marvellous
way, is, even now, causing the dawn of that blessed
day to break, when, rising above prejudice and
party spirit, she shall be allowed to take her true
place, and be, in the highest sense of the word, a
“Sister” to the suffering and the sorrowful; to
assert and claim her “rights,” the only rights of
which a woman may justly be proud.</p>

<p>Anxious, as I have said, to discover whether our
presence in the hospital was really acceptable or
not, I have closely watched the countenances of
the men on the entrance of the lady visitors. I
speak not now of myself, for I am merely one, and
a most insignificant one, among many; but I can
truly say, that at all such times I have never, but
once, seen other than an expression of pleasure,
and the warm greeting is apparently most sincere.
The one instance to which I allude, is certainly no
argument against the presence of ladies; it extended
to every one who approached his bedside, and was
produced by intense physical anguish, acting on a
highly nervous organization. I merely name it
now, because it is, as I have said, the sole instance
in which we were not welcomed and urged to stay.
And yet, the very words, in that suffering, pleading
tone, “Dear lady, please to go away, I am so very
wretched,” proved that it was no dislike to us
personally, but merely that terrible state, too well
known to any one of a very nervous temperament,
when even the stirring of the air by the bedside
seems a pain. Subsequent events, which I have
noted elsewhere, show this to have been the case.</p>

<p>At the time of the visit of the Surgeon-General
of the United States to inspect the hospitals, it
was rumored, though wholly without foundation,
that his object was to change the organization and
remove the ladies. The burst of feeling with which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
this rumor was received was more than gratifying,
it was convincing, and proved that if the men were
“victimized” they were quite unconscious of it.
Only a day or two since, as I was sitting by one
of our sick men, M. passed with some preparation
in her hand, which she had just made. He turned
to me, and pointing to her, said, “I don’t think all
our angels are in heaven, do you?”</p>

<p>The same feeling, though not always expressed
in the same words, seems to be entertained by one
and all. “Tell me,” said I to one the other day,
“if I am in your way?”</p>

<p>“In our way!” said he, “is the green grass in
our way?”</p>

<p>“No, for you walk over it, and I have no wish
to be trampled on.”</p>

<p>He looked disappointed. “I didn’t mean that,
Miss, I meant its presence always cools and refreshes
us, and I thought you’d understand.”</p>

<p>“I did quite understand, and thank you,” I said,
sorry that I had pained him by rejecting the well-meant
expression of feeling.</p>

<p>Any one who seriously desires to ascertain the
truth, (and to such only do I address myself) will
believe that these instances are not recorded for
the sake of retailing compliments, but as proofs of
a far deeper feeling, which, there can be little doubt,
does exist in the hearts of the men amongst whom
we are appointed to minister.</p>

<h2 id="OUR_DAILY_WORK">OUR DAILY WORK.</h2>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">August</span>, 1862.</p>

<p>You ask me, dear C., the usual question, when our
work at the hospital is mentioned, “What can the
ladies find to do all day?” I might give you the
stereotyped answer, “We receive and register the
donations, give out and oversee the clothing, make
either delicacies or drinks for the men who are ill,
read to them, write for them, and try to make
ourselves generally useful.” This is the ordinary
answer, but I think it would be more agreeable to
you to come and see for yourself; one day is a
pretty good specimen of every day, at least at
present, so don your bonnet and jump into the
cars with me. What do you say? That the sun
is too scorching and the air too heavy for exertion?
You think so here, but come with me, and you will
soon forget weather and self in more important
affairs; at least, so I find it. You agree? Well,
then, here we are; why don’t you acknowledge the
guard’s salute as we enter? Shall we pause for a
moment in the wards, before we begin our work?
I think we had better do so, for in these days, when
we once enter our room, there is no escape, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
the light lasts. There are several cases here which
I should like to point out to you as we pass along,
though we cannot give much time to them to-day.
Do you see the man bending over that geranium
plant in the window? I think I have never seen a
more real, true, deep love of flowers in any one than
in him. You see how lovingly he leans over that
bush, as though each leaf were a special pet and
darling. I have often, this summer, brought him
a few roses&mdash;as much, I believe, for my own pleasure
as his&mdash;that I might watch his delight. He
would sit often for nearly an hour looking at them,
holding them in his hands and lingering over them,
it seemed, with a feeling too deep for words.</p>

<p>I never could tell whether it was pure love of the
flowers themselves, or whether they brought home,
with all its memories, before him; and as he is
very reserved, I content myself with giving the
enjoyment without being too critical as to its cause.</p>

<p>But while I am talking, I see that your eyes are
wandering to that bed, where one of our sickest
men is lying. He is an Irishman, and far gone in
consumption, poor fellow! He has interested me
much by his air of silent, weary suffering, and
from his loneliness; he seems to have no friends
anywhere, and is very grateful for the least service
rendered him. And yet he has a good deal of
drollery about him, and when his pain will let
him, often amuses the men with his dry remarks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
The other day, as I passed him, his hard, hollow
cough was followed by such a deep, heavy sigh,
that I stopped at once, saying, “What can I do for
you, Jones? Is there nothing that you want?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, ma’am, nothing; sure, and what I
want, is what you can’t give.”</p>

<p>“Tell me what it is; perhaps I may be able to
help you.”</p>

<p>“Sure, and it’s lonely I am, so very lonely; and
it’s some one to love that I’m wanting.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” said I, “you were right to say I couldn’t
help you, for unfortunately wives are not provided
by Government.”</p>

<p>Here his Irish humor gained the ascendant, and
with a merry twinkle in his eye, so mournful but
a moment before, he said, “But I’m thinking that’s
jist what you ladies is here for, to supply what
isn’t provided by Government.”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” said I, much amused; “but I do not
find wives among the list of luxuries on our diet-table.
Jones, look at the man at your side, the
man opposite to you, and the man directly in front
of you; ask each one of those three what is their
greatest trouble at this moment, and I happen to
know exactly what they will tell you.</p>

<p>“The one at your side is wearying for a letter
from his far distant home, which will not come,
and dreading that even on its arrival, it will only
tell him of sickness and suffering among those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
dearest to him, and which, lying here, he has no
power to relieve; the man opposite to you has just
read me a letter from his wife, telling him that she
and the children were almost starving; she has
hurt her right arm, and can no longer work, scarcely
hold the pen to write that letter, and he will send
no pay,&mdash;charging him with it, as though the poor
fellow could help it.”</p>

<p>“‘God knows,’ he says, ‘every cent I ever earned
was at her service and the weans;’ (he is a Scotchman,
as I knew, when I heard him say that) ‘but
the pay don’t come, and I lie here thinking all
night, till I sometimes feel I must pray very hard
or I shall cut my throat.’</p>

<p>“I have been trying to comfort him with the
assurance that he will be paid before long, and
have been telling him how many difficulties there
are in the way of prompt payment in the army,
and that the men must try to be patient, and
believe that the Government has a hard task, far
harder than they know, to meet all the requirements
which this sad state of things necessarily
causes.</p>

<p>“The man directly in front of you, unable as you
know to rise from his bed, has just heard of his
wife’s death, here in the city, and does not know
who will see to her funeral, nor who will take care
of his little ones; now, may not some things be
worse than loneliness?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>“Faith, an’ its truth you’re spakin’; a sight
worse are such things than all this pain and cough;
and I’ll think of that same, when the other thought
comes, when my breath’s so short, and the pain’s
so bad, that longing to have an old woman to say,
‘Is it sufferin’ ye are, Jones, dear?’ and I’m just
the sort to fret, if she was wantin’, and I lyin’
here, not able to help her. Thank you, ma’am, I
see it’s far best as it is.” And I left poor Jones,
convinced that there were circumstances in which
an “old woman” was better “in posse,” than “in
esse.”</p>

<p>But what will become of our duties if we linger
here so long; let us go now to our room and commence
operations. Look before you. Do you know
what that barricade at the door means? Three
barrels and two large boxes, and they are saying,
“Unpack me, unpack me, or there will be nothing
left.” Do you wonder how I have found out that
such are their views? Everything on earth has a
mode of its own of conveying ideas; look at the
bottom of those barrels, and the floor near those
boxes, and you will find that red stream gently
flowing there, quite as eloquent and quite as easily
understood as any words. That is liquid currant
jelly, which, probably, as in a box we opened
yesterday, has been of an adventurous turn of
mind, one of the Peripatetic school, and not content
with the narrow limits to which its friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
have confined it, has burst its bounds, and made
acquaintance with sheets, shirts, and stockings;
and you will soon see a mournful mélange of jelly,
broken glass, and clothing; and fortunate for you
if you do not mingle your own blood with it before
you are done. Do not imagine that all our boxes
have such a sad fate; many arrive in prime order,
but whenever we see that suspicious color at the
bottom of barrels and boxes, we know what to
fear. Only a day or two ago, a large box, containing
a dozen and a half large earthenware crocks
of apple-butter, arrived, from which we could only
rescue two, the others being a motley mass of buttered
earthenware and straw, scarcely a desirable
article for hospital diet. Dear friends in the country!
whose generous hearts prompt you to send
delicacies to the sick and suffering soldiers, let me
beg for more careful packing; slats of wood between
the jars would prevent them from falling together,
as they usually do when hurriedly lifted up and
placed on end; we regret the loss as much, or more
than you can do, for we see the disappointment of
the men as they take out one broken piece after
another, and vainly try to separate crockery or
glass from preserves.</p>

<p>Here comes a ready helper. Yes, John, roll them
right into our room, and please bring a hatchet and
open that box for us; I know it’s all sticky, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
that can’t be helped, we must do the best with it
that we can.</p>

<p>And now, while he is taking the lid of the box
off for us, and opening the barrels, take a seat and
look round you. This is the ladies’ room, where we
spend so much of our time, and where all our work
is done. But first, let me put our kettle on the
stove, we must soon begin our cooking; for as I
have told you, we prepare the delicacies for the
men who are ill; cook eggs for them, stew oysters,
make corn-starch, farina, arrow root, or chocolate;
don’t laugh! yes, even I have found “ignorance”
so far from “bliss,” that with M.’s valuable instructions,
I am really learning to do something useful,
incredible as it appears to you. What do you say?
That you would not care to test the truth of my
statements by taste? Ah well! you shall not be
tried, and in the meantime the men are satisfied,
which is my only aim. The clothing you see here
on the shelves, consists almost entirely of donations.
We do not keep the Government clothing here&mdash;at
least only certain articles&mdash;as all the flannel is
drawn by the men and taken from their pay; but
we have been so liberally supplied from the different
Churches, and from various societies, that it has
generally been in our power to give them what
they need, and allow them to retain the articles.</p>

<p>“Well, little one, come here, bring me your box,
and I will empty it for you. Nice fresh lint, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
linen, and clean, too; that will be much better
than what you brought before; and now here is
your box; I will tell the poor wounded soldiers
that a kind little girl made it for them; and, goodbye
now, run home, for we have so little room here,
and so many things to do, that little girls are only
in the way.”</p>

<p>This is only the advance guard of the little army,
which daily, from “morn till dewy eve,” keeps
pouring in, company after company,&mdash;I might
almost say regiment after regiment,&mdash;with their
little boxes or papers of lint, often made of muslin,
and bearing the impress of the little soiled fingers
that picked it. But we always receive it and
thank them. Whether it can be used or not, the
kind intention is the same, and who could have the
heart to refuse the offering of a child? More than
this, the beaming faces and sunny smiles with
which they present it, as though it were some
precious gift, more than atone for the time they
occupy in attending to them.</p>

<p>Turn the key in that closet door, and you will
see all our jellies, preserves, wines, syrups, etc. It
is so full just now, that it was proposed to run up
another room for a donation room, as we really do
not know where to pack away all our things; but
the surgeon tells us, what is very true, that this
cannot last; at the present time there is an unusual
interest and excitement, which can scarcely continue,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
and we must take care of these things till
the time of need. Ah! take care, John! there
goes the top; look into the box; just as I thought;
see, what masses of jelly and broken glass; what
nice fine handkerchiefs, too good for the purpose
by far; carry them straight to the laundry; but
no! that was the way Susan got that bad cut the
other day; bring a pan, and we will let them soak
here first. Just look at these poor books; with
red edges, indeed, and rubricated throughout; and
writing-paper, too, all soaked with this erratic
currant jelly; and what is this? A pen; “currente
calamo,” indeed, in a new sense. And these
nice pillow-cases, and towels, and sheets,&mdash;but they
can be washed; what is next? A bundle of&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>“My punches ready, miss? for the fourth ward,
ten to-day; here’s the Doctor’s list.”</p>

<p>“Not just yet, Price; you’re always in such a
hurry for your men.”</p>

<p>“You see, miss, they wouldn’t take any breakfast,
and I want something for them.”</p>

<p>This from the most faithful and attentive of
wardmasters. At the beginning of each week, we
receive our orders from the surgeon of each ward
as to how many men need milk punch, extra nourishment,
etc. The wardmaster also has a list, and
his duty is to come to us, get their drinks, and take
them to them; but if there is any delay the ladies
usually take them to the men themselves, that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
may be certain of having them at the proper time
M. kindly undertakes that part of the work to-day
so let us get on with our unpacking.</p>

<p>Let us take out this bundle and see what it is.
Enter at this moment three men, each bearing a
large market-basket. “These are donations from
the &mdash;&mdash; Society; please let us have the baskets
and an acknowledgment for the things.” This
sounds trifling, but it means that everything must
be taken out, a list made and sent to the Officer of
the Day to write an acknowledgment.</p>

<p>Let us do it as quickly as we can; but here comes
one of our wardmasters. “Well, Henry, what do
you want?”</p>

<p>“Twelve wounded men, ma’am, just come in;
the ambulances we were looking for have just got
here, and we want a change of clothing for each
of them.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you shall have them at once, but stand out
of Green’s way; look what he and William are
carrying.”</p>

<p>“Green, where did those come from?” Two
large boxes of oranges and one of lemons.</p>

<p>“Dr. &mdash;&mdash; says, miss, these have just been sent,
and he would like to have them picked over, as
they’re spoiling so fast.”</p>

<p>“Well, try and find a place for them on the
floor, and tell Arnold to come here in a few minutes,
and help us to do it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>You may wonder that we do not leave such work
entirely to the men, but they understand “picking
them over” in the sense of “picking and stealing;”
and I am afraid that unless we assisted there would
be few left for the sick when the work was done.
The men are always ready and glad to help us in
anything that we allow them to do; indeed, I have
often been surprised at the promptness with which
they offer their services to spare us in every way;
to carry and empty water for us, to run our errands,
to watch our fire; in short, to render any little service
which is most needed at the moment, and
which we should naturally do for ourselves, unless
the offer were made.</p>

<p>Enter a group of women&mdash;I humbly beg their
pardon&mdash;ladies, I should have said. Ah! I know
too well their errand before they speak. Persons
have been coming all the week for the same purpose.</p>

<p>“Can we see the rebel? Please to show us the
ward where the rebel is confined?”</p>

<p>“I am sorry, ladies, but it is quite impossible&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Eight punches for our ward, Miss &mdash;&mdash;, are they
ready?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Williams, standing on the shelf there; take
them on that waiter.”</p>

<p>“The surgeon in charge has given strict orders
that no visitors are to be admitted to that ward,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
as there are some men dangerously ill there, and
he wishes it kept perfectly quiet.”</p>

<p>“But we’ve come a great way to see him, and
we must get in.”</p>

<p>“Are you friends of his? If so, I will see the
surgeon about it.”</p>

<p>“Friends of a rebel! Not exactly, thank you.
We want to see what he’s like.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry, but you cannot see him. However,
I can assure you that he is exactly like any of
these men you see around you; were you to go
into the ward you could not distinguish him, unless
he were pointed out to you.”</p>

<p>Enter a man, with a large glass bowl of jelly.</p>

<p>“Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;’s compliments, and please give me
the bowl to take back.”</p>

<p><i>Mem.</i> Jelly to be emptied; nothing to empty
it into. During the search, gloomy party gaze
moodily upon the operation, but show no signs of
departure.</p>

<p>“Brown says, ma’am, you promised to poach
him a couple of eggs for his dinner; he sent me
to see if they were done.”</p>

<p>“It is not dinner time yet; tell him they shall be
ready when he hears the drum tapped.”</p>

<p>“Have you a flannel shirt, miss, for this man?
he’s just come in.”</p>

<p>Look at the indignant party; they are evidently
returning to the assault.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>“Where’s the head doctor? He’ll let us in, we’ll
see if he won’t!”</p>

<p>“The Surgeon in charge is not here at present;
the Officer of the Day is in the office; you must
have seen him when you were admitted.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! not him; some friends told us to ask
for the ladies; that’s the way we got in; we knew
they kept the rebel so close, no use to ask for him.”</p>

<p>A woman with a basket of eggs.</p>

<p>“Some eggs from Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;; please let me have
the basket.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and thank Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; for her kindness; she
never forgets us, and her nice fresh eggs are most
acceptable to the sick men. And now, indeed we
must hurry, and put some of this mass of things
in their places on the shelves; for this table will
be wanted, after dinner, for the donations from the
schools; it is the time when they pour in.”</p>

<p>“Does he eat with the others?” Supposed to
refer to the rebel, and answered accordingly.</p>

<p>“Yes, madam, at the common dining-table.”</p>

<p>“Does he talk much?”</p>

<p>“That I cannot inform you, as I have never
exchanged a word with him.”</p>

<p>“Do they treat him kindly?”</p>

<p>“Precisely as the other men are treated.”</p>

<p>“And you think we can’t see him?”</p>

<p>“It is quite impossible, for the reasons I have
mentioned.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, Jane, there’s no use waiting; come along;
I heard there was one at the &mdash;&mdash; hospital; let’s
go there and try.” Discomfited party depart
abruptly.</p>

<p>I am glad that you should see this for yourself;
otherwise I think you would hardly credit my
statement, that this has not happened only once
or twice, but literally every day this week, with
different parties, and variations in the modes of
trying to gain admittance. It is indeed difficult
to account for this morbid curiosity with regard
to the Southern prisoners. I have sometimes
thought that it might be an unconscious tribute
to loyalty, and that the crime of rebellion was
looked upon as such a fearful one, that it must
of necessity affect even the external appearance
of all engaged in it; be that as it may, I do most
sincerely believe that were Du Chaillu himself to
hold an exhibition here of one of his Gorillas, it
would attract less attention than the presence
of this one poor misguided rebel. There! while
I have been moralizing upon rebels and the rebellion,
don’t you think I have given that shelf
rather a neater appearance, and that the table is
beginning to look a little less loaded; but oh, dear!
look at this box at the door; what more is coming?
Oh! I see what it is. I know well that box by
the flag painted on the top. Kind friends from
the country send us that; we have a duplicate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
key; empty and return it to have it filled and
sent to us next week. The contents are most
acceptable, but as you see, it must be attended to
at once, and as exactly this work will go on till
night, I think you have had quite enough of it,
and had better say goodbye to us and our room.
This day, just as you have seen it, is a counterpart
of every day, not only of this week, but of the
last three months. It will not, of course, continue;
but, although we would be the last to check the
generosity of warm-hearted friends, it makes our
duties here a little arduous just at present.</p>

<p>And now let me go with you to the door, and
say goodbye. If you find that you are not too
much wearied, I shall hope for another visit, in
some future week, when I may have time to take
you through the wards, and I can show you some
of our interesting cases; but I think what you
have seen to-day, will furnish the best answer I
could give to your question, “What can the ladies
find to do there, all day?”</p>

<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse">“God’s finger touched him, and he slept.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A steady, pouring rain. The fog, which in the
early morning hesitated whether to roll off and
give us one of those beautiful, bright autumn days,
the more precious because we feel they are gliding
so rapidly from us, or to come down in rain, seems
to have decided at last, and a dreary, drenching
rain is the result. As we<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> enter the hospital, a
glance is sufficient to tell that some depressing
influence is at work; instead of the bright, happy
laugh which so often astonishes us on our entrance,
we see the men hanging listlessly and languidly
round; some grouped in a corner of the dining-room
round a piano, which a few generous hearts
have supplied for their amusement; some trying
a game of cards or back-gammon; others lying
on benches, “chewing the cud of sweet and bitter
fancies,” the latter class having the ascendancy, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
judge from the countenance. Nor is the scene
brighter in the wards; the damp air has driven
those suffering from rheumatism and fever to their
beds once more; and after the first bright smile of
welcome, which never fails to greet us, the words,
“Poor William there, is dying!” are sufficient to
account for the depression, without waiting for
what follows, “and I expect I shall go next.”</p>

<p>It is often asserted that the sight of such constant
suffering and death, so hardens and accustoms
the men to the fact, that they do not appear
to feel it in the slightest degree. My own observation
has led to a directly opposite conclusion.
It is only natural, that a death here, where every
trace of it is necessarily so speedily removed, may
and must be as speedily forgotten; but, at the time,
I have always noticed a far greater effect from it
than I could have looked for; greater respect and
sympathy for the feelings of any relations present;
greater solemnity in witnessing the awful change;
greater tenderness in the subsequent care of the
body. As an illustration, it was but yesterday,
that one of the wardmasters, coming for a shirt
to lay out one of our poor fellows, just dead, said,
“Give me any one, one of the worst will do,” and
then, as though the words struck a chord, he added
instantly; “One of the worst! Oh! how sorry I
am, I said that; poor fellow! poor fellow! he
wouldn’t have said that for me;” and as I turned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
I saw the rough arm in its red flannel shirt, brushing
away a tear, of which he surely need not have
been ashamed.</p>

<p>“Poor William is dying.” Yes, too truly. We
need not the words of the Surgeon in charge, as
he passes, “Don’t trouble him with that poultice, it
is too late;” one glance is sufficient; and yet as I
approached the bed I started involuntarily. The
man had only been here a short time, and had
never seemed in any way remarkable; of small
size, very ordinary appearance, light hair, blue
eyes, and a quiet, gentle manner. He had not
been considered in danger, though suffering from
an attack of acute bronchitis; for in this war
truly may it be said,</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>But now,&mdash;could it be the same? I looked at
name and number to satisfy myself. I have no
wish to exaggerate, but <em>transfigured</em> was the word
which rose to my mind then, and whenever I have
since thought of that face. The wonderful change
seemed already to have passed upon the spirit,
which looked forth from those large, clear, blue
eyes, double their usual size, as with an eager,
wistful gaze they were evidently fixed upon a
vision too bright for our earth-dimmed sight, while
a smile, a radiant smile, played round his lips. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
was not the poor Private, dying afar from friends
and home, alone in a ward of a hospital, with the
pitiless rain pelting overhead; it was a soul passing
from earth, resting on its dear Lord, strengthened
and comforted for the dread journey by a vision
of the Guard of Angels sent to bear it to its rest
in Paradise; the unearthly peace, the blessed brightness
of that face, could not be mistaken.</p>

</div>

<p>The doctor’s hand is on his pulse, sustaining
stimulants are steadily given, and once more a
fitful gleam of life appears; he rallies for the
moment. We hear the low voice of the chaplain,
kneeling at his side, “You would not object to a
prayer?” The wandering eyes say more than the
languid lips, which can but frame, in a tone of
surprise, the word, “object?” The same bright
smile, the same far-off gaze as the words of prayer
ascend.</p>

<p>“You are trusting, you are resting on the merits
of your precious Saviour?”</p>

<p>Once more that strife, that sore struggle to
speak; and suddenly, as though the will had
mastered the flesh, sounds forth, in clear, strong
tones, which ring through the ward, “My only
base, my foundation!” Blessed for us all, when
that awful hour is upon us, if we can so trustfully,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
so fearlessly meet it; so fully and entirely realize
the One Eternal Rock to be our “foundation.”</p>

<p>We dare no longer call him “poor William;”
rather, as we kneel by his side, let us breathe forth
a thanksgiving for such beautiful assurance, that
his last battle is fought, his victory won.</p>

<h2 id="THE_TWO_ARMIES">THE TWO ARMIES.</h2>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">U.S.A. Hospital</span>, September 29, 1862.</p>

<p>I trust, dear C., this bright, beautiful day may
have brought you as much pleasure as it has done
to me, and that you have been able to enjoy it as
you would most wish to do. I escaped from my
duties here for one hour, and spent it you know
where. On my return, we were favored with a
visit from the Bishop of Minnesota, who is here
on his way to the General Convention.</p>

<p>He seemed much interested in going through
the wards, had a kind word and friendly greeting
for each man. One thing particularly impressed
me,&mdash;his tact in addressing them. Instead of boring
them as I do with “What is your name? What is
your regiment?” he glanced his eye upon the card
at the head of the bed, whereon all such particulars
are written, and then said, “Who is the colonel of
the Forty-fourth?” or, “Was the Eighteenth Massachusetts
much cut up?” Instantly the man
would brighten, feel that there was one who took
a personal interest, and answer with promptness
and pleasure.</p>

<p>This may seem a trifle, but to gain an influence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
anywhere trifles must be considered, and are often
all-important. My inward exclamation was, immediately,
“Here is one who has been accustomed
to dealing with men, and knows how to reach
them.” A few well-chosen questions will often
go further, and be of more benefit, than a long
sermon.</p>

<p>As you have expressed some interest in L&mdash;&mdash;,
you will forgive me for repeating a conversation
to which this visit gave rise. A little later, I
returned for some purpose to his bedside.</p>

<p>“That’s a nice man you brought here; what
was it you called him?”</p>

<p>“The title I gave him,” said I, “he gained by
promotion in our Army.”</p>

<p>“Our army! I knew it, by the way he talked;
then he’s a volunteer?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Ever been in a battle?”</p>

<p>“Many of them.”</p>

<p>“Wounded?”</p>

<p>“Often.”</p>

<p>“That’s bully. But what battles? Fair Oaks?
That’s where I was hit.”</p>

<p>“He never told me so, but I should judge his
hardest fights were before the breaking out of this
rebellion.”</p>

<p>“Ah, in Mexico?”</p>

<p>“No, I never heard of his being in Mexico.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>“A foreigner?”</p>

<p>“No, I believe him to be an American.”</p>

<p>“It can’t be, then, for he looks too young for
our other war. Didn’t he tell you what battles?”</p>

<p>“No, he never told me, nor did any of his
friends.”</p>

<p>“Then how the &mdash;&mdash;, I beg ten thousand pardons,
miss, but how can you know he was in them?”</p>

<p>“Because it is my privilege to be a Private in the
same Army. I said <em>our</em> Army was the one in which
he had gained promotion; and It’s peculiarity is,
that It will receive as recruits both women and
children.”</p>

<p>Impossible as it may appear to you, he fixed his
eyes upon me with an air of bewilderment, and
remained perfectly silent. I continued:</p>

<p>“Although I am not eligible for promotion as he
is, but must remain a Private always, I have had
some of the same battles to fight, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Psha! you’ve been fooling me all this time, and
I never saw it.”</p>

<p>I smiled. “Not fooling,” I said, “but answering
a question you asked the other day. Have you
forgotten when you said ‘Little you know of
battles!’ that I replied, ‘And yet, maybe, I have
fought harder ones than you ever did?’ You then
asked me what under the sun I could mean? I
promised to tell you, and I have only done so in
a round-about way. Have you forgotten one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
thing more? What was it I asked you to give
up, when you said you had rather be shot?”</p>

<p>His color rose, but he said nothing.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t that prove that my battles, and those
of that ‘nice man,’ as you term the bishop, are
harder to fight than yours?”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s truth you’re saying; I’d liever go
back to my regiment to-morrow, wounded as I
am, than do what you want, though I know you’re
right, too;” and warmly shaking my hand, he
drew the cover over his head, and I left him to
meditate upon the two Armies.</p>

<p>You will say that the strain after originality in
such conversations, is not likely to be an over-tax
of the mental powers; but you must remember,
that what to you may be but a wearying platitude,
may be a seed, to one who receives the parallel as a
novelty, to germinate in later years.</p>

<p>We can but try all means, and leave events to
God.</p>

<h2 id="THE_CONTRAST">THE CONTRAST.</h2>

<p>“I wish to goodness they would not send their
men here, just to die!”</p>

<p>Such was the exclamation, in no very amiable
tone, which greeted my ear, as I opened the door
of one of the wards of our hospital.</p>

<p>“What is the matter, Wilson?” said I, to our
usually cheerful wardmaster.</p>

<p>“Oh! nothing, miss; I beg your pardon, only
there’s a young fellow, just brought in, who, the
doctor thinks, can’t live over the day, and I hate
to have them dying on my hands, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Wounded or sick?”</p>

<p>“It’s the typhoid, and as bad a case as ever I
saw yet, and I’ve seen a heap of them, too. There
he is, but he’s past speaking; he’ll never rouse
again.”</p>

<p>I approached the bed, where lay a “young
fellow,” truly: a boy, scarcely more than sixteen;
his long, thick hair matted and tangled; his
clothing torn and soiled; his eyes half closed;
his lips dark and swollen; a bright flush on his
cheeks, and his breath coming in quick, short,
feverish pantings, as though much oppressed. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
saw it was quite in vain to speak to him, and
merely tried to make him swallow the beef tea,
which had been ordered to be given him at certain
intervals.</p>

<p>He swallowed with much difficulty, but still it
was something that he could do even this; and I
found that although unable to speak, he understood
and endeavored to obey, directions. I therefore
ventured to doubt Wilson’s verdict, and continued
to administer the stimulants as directed. Towards
afternoon there was a perceptible improvement in
his swallowing; he roused partially, and attempted
to turn. I begged Wilson to watch him closely
through the night, keeping up the nourishment
and stimulants; urging as a motive that, as he
wasn’t fond of deaths, this was the best mode
of preventing them.</p>

<p>He shook his head. “I’ll watch him as close as
you could, miss, but it’s no use. I’ve seen too
many cases to think that poor lad can weather
thro’ it; I reckon you’re new to this sort of thing,
or you would know it too.”</p>

<p>“Did you ever hear a saying, Wilson, ‘Duties
are ours, events are God’s?’ Try, I only ask you
to try.”</p>

<p>The next morning, when I walked in, I scarcely
recognized our patient; in addition to clean clothing,
combed and cut hair, his eyes were open, large,
bright, and sparkling with a feverish brilliancy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
He was talking in a loud, excited tone; evidently
the stupor had passed off; whether a favorable
change, or denoting increase of fever, I was not
competent to decide.</p>

<p>As I drew near, I was a little startled by the
abrupt question, “Are you the woman gave me
the drinks yesterday?”</p>

<p>I assented, sure that no discourtesy was intended
by the use of the good old Anglo-Saxon term.
Strange, that by some singular freak of language
or ideas, which, I think, it would puzzle even the
learned Dean of Westminster himself to explain,
this once honored title has, at the present day,
come to be almost a term of reproach; certainly,
as I have said, of discourtesy. Were this the place
to moralize, I might see in this change a proof of
the degeneracy of modern days; and question,
whether in yielding this precious name,&mdash;sacred
forever, and ennobled by the use once made of it,&mdash;Woman
is not in danger of yielding also the
high and noble qualities which should ever be
linked with its very sound.</p>

<p>My assent was followed instantly by another
equally abrupt question, “Then you’ll tell me
where do people go when they die? That man,
there&mdash;I heard him&mdash;said I was dying; I’ve been
asking him all night, and he won’t tell me.”</p>

<p>“If you will mind what I say now, and try to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
be very still, when you have less fever, I will talk
to you and tell you all you want to know.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be dead then, and I want to know before
I die.”</p>

<p>Very sure that any excitement at present must
be injurious, after several ineffectual attempts to
divert his mind, I deemed it best to leave him,
making an excuse of other duties, and promising
to return if he would try to keep quiet. The surgeon’s
report was favorable; the change in him
was quite unexpected, and recovery was possible,
though by no means probable.</p>

<p>I left him alone, purposely, for some hours; but
the moment I re-entered the ward he exclaimed,
“Now you will tell me.”</p>

<p>Judging it better to quiet his mind, I sat down
and spoke to him quietly and gently of his home.
Home! the talisman which charms away all pain
and soothes all sorrow. Should any one ask how
to reach the men? how gain an influence over
them? I would reply by pointing them to Napoleon’s
policy, or later, to our own Burnside,
and let the fields of Roanoke and Newbern bear
witness to the success of the experiment. Attack
the centre. Storm the heart. Make a man speak
of his home. Listen, while he tells with bitter
self-reproach, how he enlisted without consent;
and how, since then, the night wind’s wail seems
mourning mother’s moan; listen to the tearful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
tale of the loneliness of some brave-hearted wife,
who sent her treasure forth, and battles nobly on
at home; (which is the harder strife?) or of the
parting hour, and clinging clasp of little arms
round that rough neck, which would not be undone,
and which may never tighten there again. And
once more listen, as I did yesterday, to an account
of a return home, on a furlough, of one bronzed
and weather-beaten by severe service and exposure;
the joyful expectation; the journey; the gradual
approach to the well-known gate; every detail
dwelt upon and lingered over; “And, if you’ll
believe it, my Charlie didn’t know me! I couldn’t
stand it nohow;” and the tears which will not be
repressed, fall thickly on the crutches at his side.
Lead a man, I say, to tell you such things as these,
and he can never again feel towards you as a
stranger; he will bring you his letters, or tell you
their contents, with a feeling that you know the
persons therein mentioned, and will sympathize
with either his joy or sorrow. The citadel is won;
he has put the key into your hands which you may
fit at any moment to the lock of his heart, and
enter at will; thus is a bond established between
you, for the proper improvement of which you
will be responsible in the sight of God.</p>

<p>But this victory, like many another we have
won, is a very partial one; the fortress may be
gained, but the difficulty is to hold it, and garrison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
it with the troops that we would fain see there.
Golden Charity, the commander-in-chief of our
forces, has had, and will yet have, many a weary
battle to wage, ere She can obtain even a foothold
in such unwonted quarters; but with the all-important
aid of Her staff officers, Faith and Hope,
we look for final success, even though we may not
be permitted to see it.</p>

<p>But do not imagine that poor Ennis has been the
victim of this digression. After a few moments’
conversation, the eager, excited tone died away,
and he told me quietly that he had been brought
up in “the woods of Jersey;” had driven a team
there, and worked on a farm; spoke of his ignorance
with pain; the great grief seemed to be
that he could not read; if he should live, wouldn’t
I teach him?</p>

<p>“Nobody never taught me nothing; will God
mind, if I should die?”</p>

<p>“Did your mother never teach you your letters?”</p>

<p>“She don’t know ’em herself.”</p>

<p>A little more talk, and the sentences became
broken, the words disconnected, and ere long I
left him in a natural, comfortable sleep.</p>

<p>He suffered terribly from pain in his head, and
the doctor had forbidden all unnecessary noise in
the ward. I was therefore not a little surprised
the next morning as I approached the door, to
hear loud, noisy singing, laughing and talking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
alternately, such as I had never at any time heard
since I had visited the hospital.</p>

<p>I paused at the door, hesitating to enter, and
knowing the state in which I had left Ennis,
both provoked and indignant. Just at that moment,
one of the orderlies came out, and to my
question as to the meaning of the disturbance,
informed me that a new case of violent fever and
delirium had just been brought in, and as the other
wards were crowded, it had been a necessity to
place him here. Thus re-assured, I walked in,
when Wilson at once came up to me with, “Oh,
Miss &mdash;&mdash; if you would only try. This man’s out
of his head&mdash;he can’t live&mdash;and the doctor ordered
us to find out where his friends are, if possible, and
let them know. He has a good deal of money in
his knapsack, and we should like to know what to
do with it; if his friends are far off, they couldn’t
be here in time, but we can’t tell.”</p>

<p>“Has he had no intervals of consciousness?” I
asked, not caring to show how I shrank from the
task.</p>

<p>“None, and he won’t have till he goes into a
stupor, and then the game’s up.”</p>

<p>I was too much worried at the time to ask
whether an “interval of consciousness” was supposed
to exist during a stupor, as his words seemed
to imply, and merely said,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>“But if you have tried in vain, what object is
there in my speaking to him?”</p>

<p>As I spoke, a burst of noisy, insane laughter
came from his lips, and rang discordantly through
the ward; he tried to spring from his bed, but was
forcibly held on each side.</p>

<p>“Perhaps it’s no good, miss, but it seemed our
last chance, and if you’d just try?”</p>

<p>Here was a trial. And yet, had I enlisted only
for sunny weather? Was I to shrink at the first
chance of service? Nevertheless, I did shrink, and,
I fear, very visibly, too; but I felt I must go forward,
or deserve to be stricken from the rolls.
Could the exact springs of all our actions be
known, I fear it would too often be seen that
they arise in many cases from motives which we
should be most unwilling to confess; so in this
case, I sincerely believe that it was the shame of
uttering the simple truth “I am afraid of him,”
which led me straight to his bedside, far more
than the benevolent wish of informing distant
relatives of his dying condition.</p>

<p>“Have you ever heard him mention any of his
family at any time?” said I to Wilson, as we
crossed the ward, half to keep him with me, and
half to know how to address this dreaded, wild-looking
creature.</p>

<p>“Yes, he did say something once about a sister,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
but if we ask him anything further, he bursts out
singing or laughing, and it’s no use.”</p>

<p>The power of the eye I had frequently heard of,
and also that a single, direct question, often steadies
the unbalanced mind. I could but try them now.
I had an indistinct impression, as I drew near, that
it would be easier to face the hottest fire of the
fiercest foe in the field, than the glare of those
eyes; but, trying to look at him steadily, I said,
slowly and distinctly,</p>

<p>“What is your sister’s name?”</p>

<p>He looked at me for a moment, surprised and
perfectly silent, and then, to my utter amazement,
replied with equal distinctness, “Susanna Weaver.”</p>

<p>“Where does she live?”</p>

<p>“Westchester, Pennsylvania.”</p>

<p>This was so evidently a success, that I ventured
further, though doubtful of the result.</p>

<p>“How do you direct your letters?” No hesitation,</p>

<p>“Mrs. Susanna Weaver, care of James Weaver,
shoemaker, Westchester, Pennsylvania.”</p>

<p>As he uttered the last word, a man who had just
come in, came up to me.</p>

<p>“What he says, ma’am, ain’t no use; he’s out of
his head, and he don’t mean it.”</p>

<p>I said nothing in reply, but was satisfied as to
the truth of my own conclusions, when, two days
afterwards, I walked in to see the veritable Susanna,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
wife of James Weaver, shoemaker, portly,
patronizing, and polite, fanning her apparently
insensible brother, and applying ice to his temples,
for the dreaded stupor had come on.</p>

<p>My poor Ennis lay for a long time in a low,
exhausted state; but the doctor gave hope, and
at length he began perceptibly to improve. His
eagerness to be taught&mdash;more especially upon
religious subjects&mdash;continued; there was something
so simple and childlike about him; so touching in
the terror which he felt with regard to death; so
winning in his weakness, so gentle in his goodness,
or his aims after it, that I could not help becoming
deeply interested in him. He knew that there was
a God&mdash;a Being to be dreaded in his view&mdash;a Life
after death; beyond this&mdash;nothing. Our blessed
Lord’s life and death, His work on earth, His
giving His life for us, all seemed new and strange
ideas which he could with difficulty grasp. Never
can I forget the intense interest with which he
followed me, step by step, through the dark and
dread story of The Last Week; I almost feared
the excitement which burned in his eager eyes,
till, as I closed, his pent-up feelings found vent in
the words, “It was too bad!” His powers of
language were limited, not so his powers of feeling;
and I imagine that we, to whom that mighty mystery
is so familiar from childhood, can scarcely
conceive its effect when heard for the first time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
He took perfect delight in hearing and learning
the prayers from the Prayer-book, and would ask
for them constantly. And here I must speak of
the wonderful power which seems to live, in the
short, terse nature of our matchless Collects, to
stay a weak and wandering mind; “the soul by
sickness all unwound” cannot bear many words;
but the concentration of devotion, in many of
those short, earnest sentences, seems to meet every
longing and to supply every want. As Ennis so
greatly needed instruction, at my request a clergyman,
who had frequently visited the hospital, and
whose ministrations were always peculiarly acceptable
to the men, came often and spent much
time with him.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> At one time, when I was not on
duty, he sent for me. “Why did you want me,
Ennis, the ladies who are here are so very kind
to you, and do everything you can want?”</p>

<p>“Not you, but I do so want that pretty prayer
you know.” The “Prayer for a sick person” from
our Prayer-book. I doubt whether any one was
ever more gratified, by being told that they were
not wanted personally, but merely for what they
could bring.</p>

<p>I must return here, for a little while, to my old
friend, whose delirium and stupor, to the wonder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
alike of physicians and nurses, passed off, after
many weeks of tedious suffering, during which
time I had talked to him, read to him, and written
letters at his dictation, quite unconscious that he
was still very much under the influence of fever.
His sister remained till she saw that he would
probably live, and then was obliged to return to
her home. He could carry on a perfectly rational
conversation, although always inclined to excitement;
and it was quite evident, from the whole
tone of his remarks, that his “hoary hairs” were
anything but a “crown of righteousness.” I link
these two cases together because they were so
linked, strangely enough, from the beginning, and
still more in the end, and so must ever remain in
my mind.</p>

<p>Several weeks passed by, during which I was
not at the hospital; and when I returned, what
was my surprise to find our patient up, dressed,
and seated by the stove. “Why, Jackson, is it
possible? How glad I am to see you so much
better.”</p>

<p>He looked at me without a sign of recognition,
rose, bowed, but said nothing.</p>

<p>“Don’t you remember me, or what is the matter?”
said I, thoroughly puzzled.</p>

<p>“I never saw you before, ma’am, did I? Never
to my knowledge.”</p>

<p>“Well done for you, Jackson!” and “That’s a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
good one, isn’t it?” burst from more than one
of the men, with a hearty laugh.</p>

<p>He looked troubled and bewildered. I saw the
whole thing at once. “Never mind, Jackson,”
said I, “you have been very ill,&mdash;as ill as it was
possible to be to recover, and you remember nothing
of that time; I suppose it seems like a long
dream.”</p>

<p>Such was precisely the case. Even the weeks
when I had supposed him perfectly conscious, were
all a blank; he had not the slightest recollection
even of being brought in, and of nothing afterwards
until the weeks during which I had been
away.</p>

<p>My pale, attenuated boy, too, was changed into
the round, ruddy young soldier, looking particularly
well in his uniform. As is so frequently the
case in typhoid fevers, he had gained flesh rapidly,
as he recovered, and felt all the buoyancy and
brightness of a thorough convalescence. I could
not avoid comparing and contrasting the two
cases. Both brought in with the same disease;
in the same apparently hopeless state; the same
surprise excited by the recovery of each; but here
the parallel ceased. The one, scarcely more than
a child,&mdash;a beardless boy, with smooth, polished
brow, rising with all the vigor of youth from this
terrible illness, and throwing off the disease as
completely as though it had never touched him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
The other, worn and scarred by life’s conflicts
more than by time; his brow deeply furrowed
more by excess than years; his hair prematurely
whitened, rising, it is true, from the disease, but
how?&mdash;without spirit, energy, or any sort of spring;
wearily dragging one foot after the other; listlessly
and languidly sitting hour after hour upon his bed,
scarcely noticing or speaking to any one. His
time of life would of necessity give a slower convalescence,
but there was far more against him
than this: a constitution broken and ruined, as
we soon found, by bad habits, which he renewed as
soon as permitted to go out, producing, of course,
a relapse. Long before I knew this, I was conscious
that I could never overcome my repugnance
to the man; at first I attributed the feeling to the
extreme dread of him I had felt at our first meeting,
and which I could not forget; but I soon
became convinced that there was a stronger reason.
If inward purity writes itself upon the outward
form, (and who can question that it does?) the
converse is equally true. There is a sort of instinct,
or rather&mdash;for that is too low a term&mdash;a sort
of spiritual consciousness, which warns us when
evil is near; that part of our being puts forth
feelers, as it were, moral antennæ, which extend
themselves in congenial soil, but recoil at the
touch of corruption of any sort.</p>

<p>Ennis soon brought me a spelling-book, given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
him by one of the men, and claimed my promise
to teach him to read. Most faithfully he studied,
but just as we were priding ourselves upon our
progress, and he was triumphantly mastering the
mysteries of “It is he,” “I am in,” the order came,
and by a strange chance, Jackson and he were to
go on to Washington together, to rejoin their
different regiments. This I exceedingly regretted,
as I looked upon Jackson as very far from a desirable
companion or example for a young boy
like Ennis. This feeling was confirmed, when, on
the morning of their departure, Jackson came to
bid me goodbye, with unsteady step and bloodshot
eye. I spoke as I felt, strongly and sternly, as I
could not but feel towards one so lately raised
from the very gate of death, and thus requiting
the Love and Mercy which had spared him. I
know not, and it matters not what I said, but when
I spoke of the fearful responsibility which would
rest upon his soul, should he lead that child committed
to his care into sin, he looked surprised
and startled, and promised me, in the most solemn
manner, that he should come to no evil through
him. It would have eased my heart of a heavy
load, could I have relied more implicitly upon that
promise; but, after all, such feelings are but a want
of Faith; because the visible guard was the last
that I should have chosen for him. I forgot that
that young boy went forth attended by a bright,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
unseen Guard, to guide and protect him through
every step of his way. And so we parted. Weeks
have formed themselves into months, and months
have formed themselves into a year, but I have
never heard of them, or even seen their names,
and cannot tell whether they are numbered among
the living or the dead.</p>

<p>I can scarcely tell why it is, but there are no
cases, in all the memories of hospital life, which
stand out so clearly stereoscoped upon my brain,
as the two of which I have just spoken.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="BROWNING">BROWNING.</h2>

<p>This morning, as I opened the door of the ladies’
room at the hospital, I found M., as usual, before
me at her post busily working. She greeted me
with “Mr. &mdash;&mdash; (our chaplain) has just been in, to
say that Browning is to be baptized this morning,
and he would like us to be present; so we shall
have to be prompt with our work.”</p>

<p>This Browning was a striking instance of the
mercy and long-suffering of our dear Lord and
Master. After a wholly irreligious life, he had
entered the army, (though quite advanced in
years,) at the breaking out of the rebellion, where,
instead of being struck down by a bullet, a long
and suffering illness in the hospital had been graciously
granted to him; it had borne its fruit, and
this day, the brow furrowed by sin, and the hair
whitened in the service of another master, are
to be moistened by baptismal waters.</p>

<p>He has been perfectly blind for many days, and
is evidently sinking. At the appointed hour we
gather around his bed, the Chaplain, the Surgeon
in charge, (whose presence and interest in the
occasion impress the men far more than he imagines,)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
M., and myself. The holy words are pronounced,
and he is enlisted as “Christ’s faithful
soldier and servant unto his life’s end;” that end,
which, alas! seems so very near. As we approach
to speak to him, he looks up, no longer with the
blank, vacant gaze of sightless eyes, which he has
worn for so many days, but with a bright smile
of recognition, saying, in a tone almost of surprise,
“Friends, dear friends, God has given me light.”
I thought he alluded to the light which had just
dawned upon his spirit, but not so; it seemed as
though the inward illumination had indeed extended
to his physical frame; sight was restored
to the darkened eye of the body also, and mercifully
continued during the few remaining days of
his life. To the many, this fact will appear a
strange coincidence; to the few, something more.</p>

<p>Scarcely has the closing prayer ascended; scarcely
have we turned to leave the bedside, when there is
a bustle&mdash;an excitement&mdash;a sudden stir. “A man
dying in the third ward; come quickly, come, won’t
you?”</p>

<p>We hasten to the spot, and to our surprise find
that the Angel of Death is before us. A man, whom
we had been watching for some time, ill with that
terrible scourge&mdash;the Chickahominy fever&mdash;and
whom we had left not half an hour since, apparently
in no danger, by some strange change is
suddenly and certainly dying. His sister, who has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
been watching him, night and day, had left him to
prepare some drink for him; in her absence he had
attempted to rise from his pillow; the effort was
too much, and he had, as she imagined, fainted.</p>

<p>But to any eye, whose sad lot it has been to watch
that dark, cold, grey shadow, once seen, never forgotten,
marvellous in its mystery, strange in its
stern solemnity, as it slowly settles on some loved
face; to any ear, that has listened to those long,
convulsive breaths, with their longer and more
dreadful intervals, it could not but be evident
that this was no fainting, but the terrible sundering
of soul and body. Man’s hand here was
powerless. In answer to the sister’s agonized appeal
to the surgeon, brandy is offered, but in vain;
and we stand silently and sadly waiting till the
dread struggle shall be ended. And still we stand,
and still we wait. It seems as though something
held and chained the soul to earth; it cannot part&mdash;it
cannot burst its earthly case.</p>

<p>One by that bed whispers to the chaplain&mdash;</p>

<p>“The Last Prayer.”</p>

<p>We kneel once more, and once more the wonderful
words of the Prayer-book speak for us in our
hour of need. It is enough. The cord is broken&mdash;the
chain is loosed; the soul seems to rise upon
the wings of those solemn words; for ere they are
done, a broken-hearted sister feels that she is alone.</p>

<p>It is not desirable to enter upon any description<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
of the sorrowful scene of excited and undisciplined
grief which followed; three hours afterwards, we
succeeded in inducing her to take an anodyne and
go to bed. Character, mental training, and spiritual
attainment, are never more clearly shown than in
the manner in which a great sorrow is borne;
much, of course, depends upon temperament, but
as a rule, I think we may safely affirm, that the
most violent outward expression has the least
inward root; that the griefs which crush and
slowly sap life, are seldom noisily and vehemently
vented in their first freshness.</p>

<p>That night, as I sat where the soft shadows of
summer moonlight played peacefully in and out
among grand old trees, my thoughts naturally
clung to the scenes through which I had been
passing, and dwelt upon those two who had both,
though so differently, that day “entered into Life;”
the one, through the Golden Gate of Baptism; the
other, through “the grave and gate of death;” and
in the calmness of that still night, the fervent wish
arose, that they might both attain a “joyful resurrection,
for His merits, Who died, and was buried,
and rose again for us.”</p>

<h2 id="BROWN">BROWN.</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Alas, long-suffering and most patient God,</div>
<div class="verse">Thou need’st be surelier God to bear with us,</div>
<div class="verse">Than even to have made us!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“How you can endure that man, is a mystery
to me,” said M., to me one morning, as, in going
through the wards, I paused at the bedside of one
of the men, whose unattractive, even repulsive
countenance fully justified the feeling. I did not
answer what was the truth, “I cannot endure him,”
for I had resolved on testing to the uttermost, my
theory, most firmly held, that there is some good
in every one&mdash;some key to the heart&mdash;some avenue
by which the soul may be reached&mdash;some smouldering
spark of good in darkest depths of evil; and
more than this, we were not there to choose interesting
cases, but to minister to all. Truly there
was little room here for the romantic interest with
which we are charged with investing our men.
Originally of very low origin, bad habits, probably
increased by the exposure of camp life, had sunk
him lower; and I confess to a feeling of shame at
the unconquerable disgust with which I approached
him; but he was sick and suffering, and I tried to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
fix my mind upon the fact, rather than upon the
cause which had produced it.</p>

<p>Several months of visiting, however, proved one
point, that he certainly had a heart; further than
this, I could not ascertain, even after many trials,
until one morning he turned to me, suddenly, and
said, pointing to the wall opposite his bed, “We
have a light all night; I can’t sleep, and I’m all
the time reading that.” I looked, and read the
text in large letters, “There is more joy in heaven,
over one sinner that repenteth,” &amp;c. “Do you
think there could ever be <em>joy</em> over me?” The
utter depression of the look, the hopelessness of
the tone, and the mournful shake of the head,
were touching in the extreme.</p>

<p>He seemed to long to do better, and promised
earnestly to seek for strength to avoid temptation.
A few weeks elapsed, and on my return, the answer
to “Where is Brown?” was, “In the guard-house;
he got better, got a pass, and, of course,
came home drunk.”</p>

<p>A severe illness followed; this occurred again
and again; the necessity for air and exercise gained
him occasionally a pass from the surgeons, always
followed by the same sad result. The men despised
him, treated him accordingly, and his case seemed
hopeless. One day, one of our poor men, who was
in a dying condition, fancied a piece of fresh shad&mdash;it
was one of those sick longings, which, of course,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
we were anxious to gratify. Permission gained to
send for it, I turned to one of the men at my side,
and said, “Will you go to the market and get it for
him?” Brown, who was standing near, sprang
eagerly forward, “Oh! do let me go for you; I
won’t be a minute, and the doctor said a walk
would be good for me.” The sad doubt in my
mind must have written itself upon my face, for
its effect was reflected by the deep pain and wounded
expression in his own. My resolution was taken
instantly, and I resolved to risk it. Holding the
money to him, I said, “Take it, then, and come
back quickly.” The blood rushed to his face, and
the beaming look of gratitude made me sure that
this was the best mode of treating him. Men are
too often just what they are assumed to be; treat
them as men of honor, such they will be; treat
them as knaves, such also they will be. I mean
not to affirm that there is no such thing as abstract
truth or principle; far from it; but I do mean to
say, that where the moral sense is weak, far more
is gained by treating men as though we trusted,
than as though we doubted. It is the unconscious
tribute paid, all the world over, to honor and virtue.
They would fain be or appear to be, all that
we think them; and who can tell how far we may
aid a sinking soul by the kind word of hopeful
trust; or, on the other hand, by assuming a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
to be utterly degraded, help to make him become
so, in reality?</p>

<p>And yet, scarcely had Brown left my sight, ere
the doubt returned. He had been doing better
lately. I had thrown him into temptation; would
he have strength to avoid it? Visions of illness,
disgrace, suffering, and the guard-house, filled my
mind. These thoughts were not dissipated by M.’s
sudden question,</p>

<p>“Who did you send for that fish? How long he
stays!”</p>

<p>With something of a pang of conscience, although
quite aware that I had acted from the best motives,
I said, courageously,</p>

<p>“I sent Brown; it is not so very long.”</p>

<p>“Brown! Oh! how could you? You know what
will happen?”</p>

<p>As I rely upon her judgment more than my own,
my anxiety is not relieved, though concealed. The
minutes grow to hours, and still no tidings of him.
Another trial; the wardmaster appears.</p>

<p>“G&mdash;&mdash; wants to know if you’ve got his fish?
you promised to send at once.”</p>

<p>“Not yet,” I said, “but I hope I shall very
soon.”</p>

<p>A very faint hope, it must be confessed. As he
left the ladies’ room, I heard one of the men say
to him,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>“G&mdash;&mdash;’ll get no fish to-day. Do you know who
she sent? Brown, if you’ll believe it.”</p>

<p>A prolonged whistle. “Didn’t she know?”</p>

<p>“She might have, by this time, one would
think.”</p>

<p>Heart sick, I turned away; my theory of trust
henceforth must have exceptions. I had led another
into sin, and he must suffer for my fault. Just at
this instant Brown rushes in, flushed and heated, it
is true, but with exercise alone,&mdash;that was quite
plain&mdash;and handing me the money, pants out,</p>

<p>“I’ve been clean to the wharf, and couldn’t get
a bit; I determined you should have it, and I’ve
been through every market I knowed on, but not
a blessed scrap could I find.”</p>

<p>“How glad I am!” broke involuntarily from my
lips; and I was only recalled to the inappropriateness
of the reply, by his look of puzzled wonder,
and “What was it you said, miss?”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” I answered; “thank you for the
trouble you have taken;” and he left me, much
mystified by my evident delight at the failure of
his errand.</p>

<p>The truth of his statement was verified by a
lady, who (her carriage at the door) offered to see
if she could be more successful. She returned, some
time afterwards, bringing some other fish, and
assuring me that it was quite impossible to procure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
any shad that day, at any price, as there was
none in the market.</p>

<h2 id="DARLINGTON">DARLINGTON.</h2>

<p>“I pity our sick men, to-day,” thought I, as I
gladly took shelter within the hospital walls from
the burning summer sun, which was beating with
unusual violence upon the hot brick pavements and
dusty streets. The city in summer, and “Dante’s
Inferno,” always seem to me synonymous terms.
It is on days like these, when the town seems so
close and crowded, the heated air so heavy and
impure, that I long to have the hospitals or their
occupants all moved to the calm, cool country,
where the poor sufferer may be beguiled from the
thought of his pain by the sweet sights and sounds
ever around him; that blessed blue, which no town
sky can ever attain, let it try its best, broken by
fair, floating masses of white clouds, their forms
ever varying, yet each seeming more beautiful than
the last; the glad, grateful green of woods and
dells, which, like a loved presence, ever unconsciously
soothes and satisfies; the soft, springing
wild flowers, with their sweet, sunny smile,&mdash;these
for the eye; while for the ear, listen to the cheerful
chime with which that little babbling brook plays
its accompaniment in “little sharps and trebles”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
to the chorus of voices overhead; no discord there&mdash;not
one false note to jar the unstrung nerve, but
all pure, perfect harmony.</p>

<p>Is there no medicine in all this? Rather, is it
not worth, for purposes of cure, all, and more than
all that the whole Materia Medica can offer? And
yet there are men living on this earth who tell
you, aye, even as though they were in earnest in
the assertion, too, that they do not love the country&mdash;they
prefer a city life. For such, I can only hope
that retributive justice may bestow upon them a
summer’s campaign in one of our city hospitals.</p>

<p>“Have you seen our new lot of wounded?”</p>

<p>“No. When did they come in? Any serious
cases?”</p>

<p>“Only a few days ago. Yes, ma’am, some pretty
bad wounds; worse than we’ve had yet&mdash;two of
them can hardly live; but take care of one of
them, when you go in; he’s as cross as thunder,
if you go within a mile of his bed.”</p>

<p>This from one of the orderlies of the first ward,
as my hand was upon the latch of the door. I
confess the announcement was somewhat alarming,
as we could then be but a few rods from his bed;
however, “forewarned, forearmed.” I enter, and
find the scene little different from usual, save that
the vacant beds are all filled, and a few more have
been added to the number, as they evidently stand
much closer than they do ordinarily. I pass on to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
the familiar faces, and after a greeting with them,
my attention is attracted by a bright, cheerful
tune, whistled in a voice of uncommon sweetness.
It comes from that bed where that poor arm is
bandaged from shoulder to finger tip, and, right
glad am I to hear it; the men who are cheerful,
are, as a rule, always the first to recover. He
stops as I come up.</p>

<p>“I am glad you can whistle; it shows you are
not suffering so much as I feared, when I saw your
bandages.”</p>

<p>He smiles, but says nothing; and I notice, as I
come closer, that large drops of perspiration are
standing in beads upon his brow; his one free
hand is tightly clenched, and a nervous tremor
runs over his whole frame.</p>

<p>One of my friends in a neighboring bed says,
“Ah, Miss &mdash;&mdash;, you don’t know Robinson yet, he’s
a new fellow, and we all laugh at him here; he says
when the pain’s just so bad he can’t bear it nohow,
he tries to whistle with all his might, and he finds
it does him good.”</p>

<p>Whether from the suspension of this novel
remedy for acute suffering, or a sudden increase
of pain, I cannot tell; but as I turn to Robinson
for a confirmation of this singular statement, the
large tears are in his eyes, and roll slowly down
his cheeks. He tries to smile, however, and says,
“Oh, yes! it does help me wonderfully; it kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
of makes me forget the pain, and think I’m at
home again, where I’m always whistling. Nothing
like keeping up a good heart. It don’t always ache
like this&mdash;only in spells&mdash;it’ll stop after a bit. Never
mind me, ma’am, I’m not half so bad as poor Darlington
there.”</p>

<p>There seemed to me something touching in the
extreme, in this earnest effort to subdue suffering
by whistling up the bright memories of home, in
the midst of such intense physical anguish, and in
the endeavor to treat his own case as lightly as
possible. Well has it been said, “Character is seen
through small openings;” and as he appeared in
this conversation, such did we find him always.
Gentle, unselfish, and bearing his terrible suffering
with a beautiful patience, ere long he became a
general favorite throughout the whole hospital;
and during the tedious months of close and constant
nursing which his case required, every one
seemed glad to help him and wait upon him at all
times. But this is anticipating, for no doubt he
will appear again, as for a long time he was one
of our prime objects of interest, from the constant
attention as to diet and delicacies which his case
required.</p>

<p>As I pass on from bed to bed, I give rather a
scrutinizing glance, in hopes of just seeing the
formidable object whom I had been warned to
avoid. But in vain. All seem quiet, and since my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
presence has stopped the whistling, nothing is
heard but the men talking in an undertone, or an
occasional low moan of pain, which seems to come
from some one asleep and suffering. Suddenly, in
my tour, I pause before a bed, struck by the expression
of intense anguish on a sweet, young face,
white as the pillow it rests upon; his fair hair
tossed from the pale brow, which is painfully contracted,
and his long, thin, taper fingers, white as
the face, move convulsively as he sleeps. He is
evidently badly wounded, for a hoop raises the
clothes from his bandaged limb. Who can he be?
Evidently those hands, even allowing for illness
and loss of blood, have never seen rough service,
and belong to some one of a higher class than we
usually see as a Private here; for although we
proudly acknowledge that some of the best blood
of the country is now in the ranks, still it has not,
as yet, been our good fortune to encounter its
presence in this hospital. There is a sort of fascination
about that face, and I stand gazing at him
and wondering over him till Richards, one of our
old attachés, comes up.</p>

<p>“Oh! he’s asleep, poor fellow, at last; that accounts
for it; the boys are all wondering how you
got so close; he’s in a great way, when he’s awake.
He couldn’t bear you that near without screaming.”</p>

<p>“Surely this can’t be the man Foster said was
‘as cross as thunder?’” said I, thinking it utterly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
impossible that here was indeed the dreaded object
I had been seeking.</p>

<p>“Well, yes, miss; the boys call him cross, but
somehow I don’t think he means to be cross; only,
you see he suffers so with that mashed-up limb,
that he’s afraid they’ll touch him when they come
near, and he calls out sudden like, and so they call
him cross; but he’s as grateful as can be, for any
little thing you do for him.”</p>

<p>“Is he very badly wounded?”</p>

<p>“Oh! yes. The doctors would have taken his
leg right off, but they say he’s too weak to stand
it; you never saw such a sight; he and Robinson,
there, are an awful pair to look at.”</p>

<p>“Is this Darlington? I heard Robinson say that
Darlington was worse than he was.”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am; the doctor says he’s not worse,
only they take it different. You see, poor Tom
here, frets all the time, and don’t give himself no
chance; but that fellow over there’ll worry through
yet, if pluck can do it.”</p>

<p>This was afterwards confirmed by the surgeon
himself. He assured me that Robinson’s wound
had appeared quite as dangerous&mdash;indeed, at one
time, even more so; but his quiet, placid disposition
aided his recovery immensely; while the terribly
nervous temperament, and high state of nervous
irritability of poor Darlington, were equally against
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m glad enough he’s sleeping,” added Richards,
“for he’s been here for three days, and this is the
first time, night or day, that I’ve caught him with
his eyes shut; lots of anodyne, too, the doctors
give him. It’s worry, worry, worry from morning
to night about his sister; he wants so to see her,
and says if she were only here, she could come
near his bed and it wouldn’t hurt him.”</p>

<p>“Where does she live? Why don’t they send
for her? he can’t live.”</p>

<p>“Away off in Michigan; and he won’t even have
her told that he’s sick; he says wait till he’s better,
and then he’ll write; but he won’t have her frightened.
If he could only forget her for a little while,
it’s my notion he’d do better; but I tell him none
of the boys here make half the fuss after their
wives that he does after his sister. Poor boy! he’s
just twenty-one since he came in here, and I rather
guess they must have thought a sight of him at
home,&mdash;at least, he does of them,&mdash;too much for
his own good, that’s certain; this terrible fretting
after home, when they’re sick, does the boys a lot
of harm.”</p>

<p>Knowing that Richards’ one talent was garrulity,
I left him and went to our room, thinking that
perhaps we might prepare something to tempt
poor Darlington’s appetite; for the surgeon told
us it was vital to keep up his strength, and yet he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
could scarcely be persuaded to touch anything
which had been brought him.</p>

<p>As I well knew, from the state they described
him to be in, that the sight of a stranger could
not be agreeable to him, we sent everything we
made for him through Richards, who constituted
himself his body-guard from the moment of his
entering the hospital, and a most faithful and
untiring nurse he proved. Never again can I say
that garrulity is his only talent; he developed then
and there a gift for nursing for which those who
best loved Darlington can never be too grateful.
Days passed on, and I soon found that (as I had
supposed) what the men termed “crossness,” was
but the sad querulousness produced by suffering,
and the state of which I have spoken.</p>

<p>While Robinson evidently gained,&mdash;though his
attacks of pain were still marked by his own
peculiar whistling, which we constantly heard in
the ladies’ room, and always knew how to interpret,&mdash;Darlington
was as evidently losing; and all hopes
of amputation were necessarily abandoned. I could
feel nothing but the most intense pity for him, and
longing to comfort him; but it seemed impossible.
M. said to me one day, “It certainly seems best,
from what we see and hear of Darlington, to send,
not take, his nourishment to him; and yet, perhaps
our presence might be more welcome; but I hesitate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
because the sight of any one coming near him
seems to throw him into such a nervous state.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said I, “any one but Richards; doesn’t
it seem a strange fancy?”</p>

<p>And so we went on, for a week or more longer;
for our interest in the case was so great, that even
when not on duty at the hospital, we felt that we
must know its progress. One day the surgeon
came to me and begged me to try to cheer up
Darlington, he was so down-hearted, would taste
no food, etc.; must certainly sink unless some
change could be made in his feelings. I went to
his bedside at once, to see if he were awake, for
much of the time he was kept under the effect
of anodyne, to deaden the excessive pain. For
many a long day did that look of deep, profound
wretchedness haunt me, as he raised his soft, clear
blue eyes to mine, and said, in the most earnest,
pleading tone, “Dear lady, please to go away, I
am so very wretched.” Any one who had ever
suffered realized that there was no crossness here;
physical suffering, acute and intense, was written
in every line of his face, sounded in every tone
of his voice, and most earnestly did I long to
soothe him.</p>

<p>Without answering, I drew back, and laid my
cold hands on his burning brow. His whole expression
changed. “You like it,” I said; “I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
so glad; we have all been wishing so much to do
something to comfort you.”</p>

<p>A sweet smile, more touching than tears, passed
over the poor white face, followed the next moment
by the painful contraction of the muscles from
suffering.</p>

<p>“But I want <em>her</em>!”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said I, “that sister! No one can take
her place; we will write, and she can soon be
here; she would come further than from Michigan,
I am sure, to see a sick brother who loves her as
you do.”</p>

<p>With more energy than I had ever seen in him,
he lifted his head from the pillow, saying eagerly,
“Never, never write to her; I wouldn’t have her
see me so for all&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>But here, either from the effort, or from a sudden
increase of pain, faintness came on; strong stimulants
and the doctor’s presence were needed, and
I left him. This, I trusted, however, might be a
beginning.</p>

<p>The next day, when I came to him, he looked
much sunken, and seemed altogether lower than
I had yet seen him. He smiled, however, and
tried to lift his hand, and point to his head.</p>

<p>“You like my cold hands,” said I, as I once
more pressed them on his throbbing temples; “but
perhaps this hot day, a little ice would be better;
let me get you some.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>He said something which I could not catch; his
voice sounded strangely weak and broken, and I
was obliged to ask him to repeat it.</p>

<p>“No! oh no! I said your hands were better
than any ice.”</p>

<p>“They put you in mind of that sister, is that it?
Well, shut your eyes now, and try to fancy, just
for a little while, that they are really hers, and
that she is standing in my place, where I know
she would so long to be.”</p>

<p>“That sister,” he said, quietly and gently, “whom
I shall never see on this earth again.”</p>

<p>This was the first time that he had so spoken;
always before he had alluded to being better&mdash;to
getting home&mdash;to writing himself to her; but now
it seemed he felt and realized his state.</p>

<p>These were the last words I ever heard poor
Darlington speak, for I never saw him again. My
week at the hospital was over; I was obliged to
leave home for a short time, and when I returned
he was at peace, and calmly laid to rest.</p>

<div class="verse">“Out of the darkness, into the light:</div>

<div class="verse">Out of the darkness into the light.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Although I was not present, I had the most
touching account of his last hours from one who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
in truth, acted a sister’s part,&mdash;watched by him,
comforted, consoled, pointed him upward, and
received his latest breath. With her own hands
she cut off a lock of that fair hair for the poor
sister, so fondly and so truly loved in her far-away
home.</p>

<p>She told me, in speaking of the last days of his
life, that after I had left, and as death drew near,
all that restlessness and irritability passed away,
and that he lay calm and peaceful as a little child;
talked to her quietly&mdash;sent messages to his home&mdash;gave
particular directions as to his funeral&mdash;saying
that it would satisfy them all at home, to
know everything had been carefully attended to,
and that they would see that it was all paid for.
Every wish was carried out; his body was wrapped
in the Flag; our own grand Service for the Dead
said over him; his faithful nurse, “Uncle Richards,”
following him to his grave,&mdash;in one of the lots
generously given by one of the cemeteries in the
neighborhood of the city. It was a great comfort
to know that he looked at Death without fear; his
mind had evidently been dwelling much and deeply
upon the subject, during many of those long hours
when we had supposed him to be in a stupor. He
expressed a sure and steadfast trust in the merits
of his dear Lord and Saviour, and rested with a
quiet confidence upon His mercy. He passed away
calmly and gently, and we have perfect trust that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
he sleeps in Paradise. Such was the account I
received on my return.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“And, comforted, I praised the grace</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Which him had led to be</div>
<div class="verse">An early seeker of That Face</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Which he should early see.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Perhaps the most pathetic part of the whole
thing, was to see the deep, real, unostentatious
grief of poor Richards, who seemed as if he had
lost a son. This was a strange case altogether.
Richards was a man who had been in the English
army; tall, fine-looking, with a military air and
bearing, which had impressed me much when he
first came to the hospital; but I soon found that
his habits were bad, and that any permission to
go out was sure to be followed by a night in the
guard-house, and days in bed. And yet a kinder
heart could scarcely be found. He had devoted
himself to more than one of the men, and watched
them night after night till their death. In one
instance, when one man whom he had been nursing
was to be taken home, here in the city, he obtained
permission to go with him and nurse him, sitting
up with him and watching him till his death. As
at such times he always remained perfectly sober,
it was suggested to make him nurse, (his disease
rendering a return to his regiment impossible,) with
the hope that the good influence over him which
this work seemed to possess, might be permanent;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
but this would not do; he could not be trusted
unless he had a special interest in the man he was
nursing, and what was necessary to create such
interest he alone knew. Whatever the qualities
were, Darlington possessed them in the highest
degree. He seemed to attract him from the first,
and the love was warmly returned. Darlington
thought no one could move him, no one could feed
him, no one could dress his wound but “Uncle
Richards, dear Uncle Richards,” as he called him;
and often have I wondered at the tender love which
seemed to exist between them. Those who were
present told me that it was truly wonderful to
watch Richards all through that last day, kneeling
at his bedside, praying with him, repeating text
after text of Scripture or hymns, as he asked for
them. One of the last things Darlington said was,
“Where is dear Uncle Richards? I want to put
my arms round his neck, and thank him for all his
goodness and kindness to me.”</p>

<p>And yet this is the man of whom some one said
to me, only a day or two since, “Why do you speak
to that worthless fellow?”</p>

<p>One day, in my next week at the hospital, Richards
came to me, and with the usual salute, which
he never forgets, said, “Miss &mdash;&mdash;, you used to care
for poor Tom, would you let me tell you about
him? The world seems so lonely to me, now he’s
gone.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>I gladly assented, and seated on an old packing-box,
in the corner of the hospital entry, I listened
to his story. He gave me every detail of his illness,
most of them already familiar to me; told, with
evident pride, how the poor fellow thought nobody
but himself could do anything for him.</p>

<p>“You mind, miss, don’t you, how the first day
you saw him, I told you he didn’t mean to be
cross, though the boys thought him so? Well,
he told me before he died, how sorry he was they
had thought so, but they could never know what
agony it was to him to see them come near him;
but now he felt that he ought to have tried to bear
it all more patiently. Poor Tom! there’s not been
many like him here, and there’ll never be any like
him to me,” and hard, heavy sobs shook his whole
frame.</p>

<p>I spoke to him of the comfort he had been to
him; of the kind way in which he had watched
him, and how we had all noticed it; and won a
promise from him, in his softened state, that henceforward
he would try so to live as to meet him
hereafter; and I really believe that at the time he
was sincere; but habit is a fearful thing, and the
struggle against a sin so confirmed more fearful
still.</p>

<p>Some days afterwards, he came to me, when
there were others present, and said:</p>

<p>“I had a letter from <em>her</em> to-day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>My thoughts were far enough from Darlington
at the moment, and I answered,</p>

<p>“From whom?”</p>

<p>“From <em>her</em>, you know!”</p>

<p>“And who do you mean by ‘her?’”</p>

<p>“His sister, to be sure,” he said, in an injured
tone, as though I should have known that, at
present, there was but one subject for him.</p>

<p>“Oh, have you? What does she say?”</p>

<p>“Not now, not now,” he said, looking at the
others, as though the grief were too fresh, the
subject too sacred, to be mentioned so publicly;
“but I just thought you’d like to know.”</p>

<p>At a quiet moment, the next day, he begged me
to let him tell me what she had written;&mdash;her
warm, earnest thanks to him for all his love and
tenderness to her darling brother; and begging
him to plant some flowers where he was laid to
rest. This may never be in his power, but there
are those who will never forget to care for and
cherish the low grave of that young Private.</p>

<h2 id="LITTLE_CORNING">“LITTLE CORNING.”</h2>

<p>Let no one imagine that hospital life is all gloom.
Sickness and suffering are, of course, the normal
condition, but we try to crowd in all the brightness
we can; games, gayety, and gladness, have their
place. One such presence as that of “Little Corning”
must insure some sunshine. How can I describe
that quaint, droll, merry little sergeant, once
seen, never to be forgotten?</p>

<p>“Little Corning,” we always called him, to distinguish
him from our tall wardmaster of the same
name; and most appropriate, too, did it seem to
his little, short, squat figure. I always contended
that he had been a sailor, from the roll and pitch
in his gait, and a certain way he had of giving a
lurch whenever he wanted to reach anything near
him. He assured me most positively that such
was not the case; but I still continue to think
that he must have been, in some former state of
existence, if not in this. Many men have been
convicted before now on circumstantial evidence,
why should not he be also? Perhaps he did not
choose to confess the fact&mdash;no man is bound to
criminate himself&mdash;therefore I see no good reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
for giving up my first conviction, and many for
holding it; ergo, I repeat that I think he had been
a sailor.</p>

<p>I never heard a merrier laugh, or knew a happier
nature. He seemed to possess the blessed faculty
of shedding sunshine and joy all around him; many
a harsh word has been hushed, many an incipient
quarrel checked, by his odd, dry way of placing
things in a ludicrous light, and thus changing
churlishness into cheerfulness, moroseness into
merriment. Momus certainly presided at his birth,
touched him with his wand, and claimed him for
his own.</p>

<p>He had the best reason for his uniform cheerfulness;
indeed, the only one which can ever secure
it. His Christianity was of a truly healthy order,
and certainly brought him both content and peace.
During his residence of many months in the hospital,
I never saw a frown upon his face, or heard
anything but a bright, joyous laugh, or pleasant
word from him. Often, in my rounds, I would
come upon him, unexpectedly, in some obscure
corner, poring over his Bible, apparently quite
absorbed in it, and yet always ready to lay it
aside when he could make himself useful, but
returning to it as a pleasure, when his work was
accomplished.</p>

<p>He had a remarkably fine tenor voice, and I have
often seen men of all sorts and tastes gathered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
round him, listening by the hour to Methodist
hymns, for the sake, we must suppose, of those
uncommon tones, rather than of the words which
called them forth.</p>

<p>One morning he came into the ladies’ room, and
informed us, with much delight, that Mr. &mdash;&mdash; had
promised to ask some of the pupils from the Blind
Asylum to come to the hospital the next evening,
to give a concert, begging us to be present.</p>

<p>I told him that, for one of us, that would be quite
impossible; it would be pleasant, but could not be
arranged. He seemed much disappointed, but soon
left the room, and I had forgotten all about it, when,
an hour or two later, he burst into the room, quite
radiant, exclaiming, “It’s all fixed, we’ve got it all
fixed.”</p>

<p>“What’s all fixed?” said I, my mind intent on
some refractory oysters which refused to boil.</p>

<p>“The concert, to be sure. Mr. &mdash;&mdash; has arranged
it for to-morrow afternoon, and now you’ll come.”</p>

<p>I thanked him, and gladly accepted for us both,
promising to make all our necessary preparations
for the supper of our sick men, quite early, so that
we might be ready in time. At the appointed hour,
the next afternoon, “Little Corning” presented
himself.</p>

<p>“Come, ladies, come quickly! the boys are all in
the dining-room; I’ve brought chairs for you, and
they’re quite ready to begin.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>“Wait a minute; not just yet; sick men come
first.”</p>

<p>“Oh! please now, come, won’t you? Suppose
just for once that the boys are sick on the field,
and never mind them to-night.”</p>

<p>“For shame, sergeant! Such counsel from you?
We cannot believe it. Go in, and we will follow
you.”</p>

<p>But although music is his passion, and he is
burning to be there, he gallantly prefers to wait,
and be our escort; and in pity for him, we hurry
as much as possible; and now we are done; let
us go.</p>

<p>There are our chairs, all arranged for us. What
a crowd! At least, a crowd for our number of
well men,&mdash;over a hundred, certainly; all who are
fit to be out of their beds, and some who, we very
well know, are not. See how they are jammed
together; on benches, on the dining-table itself,
in the windows, and on every available spot, battered
and bandaged, <em>wrappered</em> and wrinkled, suffering
and smiling, in one promiscuous mass. Look
at that pale boy, sitting on the corner of the table
on our right; he has been as ill as possible with
typhoid fever, and surely can never sit through the
concert in that position. Let him try for a while,
however; the whole scene will do him more good,
by amusing and diverting his mind, than the exertion
can do him harm. Truly, as we glance around,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
it is a strange scene. Men from North, East, and
West, gathered together&mdash;in dress and undress
uniform; from the cavalry jacket, with its yellow
facings, to dressing-gowns and even shirt-sleeves;
all eagerly and earnestly bent upon one idea; but
even as they gaze, can you not read their characters,
and place their homes? Each State has its
own characteristics so strongly marked, that I
have often laughingly promised to tell each man
in a ward, from whence he came; and after a little
practice, one seldom makes a mistake,&mdash;at least
never wanders far from the truth; but we cannot
stop to discuss that point now, as the songs are
beginning.</p>

<p>But stop! It cannot be. Look, M., look! It
actually is. Our naughty, disobedient, handsome
Harry, with his bandaged limb on a chair, over
there by the window. Only this morning did I
hear the surgeon give orders to have that limb
put in a fracture-trough, as the only means to
preserve perfect stillness for it. I saw, later, that
it had been done; and now look&mdash;everything removed,
and here he is. That was a very severe
wound, from which he has been suffering for many
months; he told me yesterday, that, in all, fifty
pieces of bone had been taken out of his leg; the
surgeons rather pride themselves on having prevented
the necessity of amputation by the closest
watching and care; and we cannot help feeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
provoked with him for persisting in moving about,
when perfect rest is so essential to his cure. And
yet, who could ever be angry with Harry, for any
length of time? He has a way of his own of winning
us over to his side, and we know what a warm
heart beats beneath that wilfulness; but arguments
with him are of little avail; the other day, in reply
to my earnest remonstrances, he said:</p>

<p>“But, Miss &mdash;&mdash;, my leg is my own, and if I like
to have a little fun now, and lose it afterwards, will
any one but myself suffer?”</p>

<p>We have almost given him up as incorrigible.
Patriotic songs are fast following each other,&mdash;and
certainly the applause is “sui generis.” Crutches
pounded on the floor, and splints hammered on the
table, with an energy and fervor which threaten
their own destruction; but the sightless singers
receive it all apparently with the greatest satisfaction,
deeming that the greater the noise, the
greater the pleasure, and probably such is the
case.</p>

<p>Listen. What is that tall singer saying? He
has already twice repeated it, but he cannot hope
to be heard in this confusion. See!&mdash;he is trying
again: “I want you all to be quite still now, and
listen to this song; make no noise, if you please.”</p>

<p>An instant hush, and eager expectation on every
face. The singer begins the well-known “Laughing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
Chorus,”&mdash;well-known here, but evidently a perfect
novelty to these listeners.</p>

<p>For a few moments there is an effort to maintain
quiet, but suddenly their pent-up feelings break
forth, and peal after peal of heartiest laughter
rings through the room. In vain they try to stop&mdash;a
moment’s pause, and the singer’s voice is heard,
seeming only to give the key-note, which one after
another takes up, till, in the wild storm that follows,
they are entirely unaware that he has come to a
conclusion&mdash;that it is all over and done, and the
singers are leaving. Just at this moment my eye
is caught by our friend, the sergeant, his head
resting on the table, his face almost purple, and
his whole frame literally convulsed with laughter.</p>

<p>“Corning! Corning! stop! you will be sick.”</p>

<p>But in vain; that laugh must be laughed out;
and he cannot even recover himself sufficiently to
join in the vote of thanks which the men are offering
to the kind friend who had given them this
enjoyment.</p>

<p>The next morning, when I arrived, I said to M.
at once, “How is Harry, to-day?”</p>

<p>“Not in the least the worse, by his own account;
but I hear Little Corning is in bed&mdash;actually made
sick, from the effects of the concert.”</p>

<p>This scarcely surprised me, as I had feared it,
knowing that he was far from strong.</p>

<p>A little later in the morning, something called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
me over to the ward in which he was, and as I
entered I heard a groan; to my surprise, it came
from our little friend, who was, as M. had heard, in
bed, and evidently suffering.</p>

<p>“Why, sergeant,” said I, “I am sorry to see that
the concert has had such a bad effect.”</p>

<p>But at my approach the groan was turned into
a hearty laugh, though it was quite plain that the
suffering continued.</p>

<p>“Oh! Miss &mdash;&mdash;, don’t, please don’t! I can’t
begin again. I ache all over in each separate
muscle, and I’ve lost all faith in you.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want you to begin again; but what do
you mean by having ‘lost faith in me?’”</p>

<p>“Why, don’t you remember, you always said a
good laugh was the best medicine?&mdash;and it’s come
near killing me&mdash;oh, dear! oh, dear!”</p>

<p>“That bottle, standing on the table at your side,
Corning, is marked to be taken by the teaspoonful;
perhaps, if you were to empty it at a dose, it might
have the same effect. I never recommended such
immoderate laughter.”</p>

<p>“Oh, please don’t speak of it. It brings it up
so.”</p>

<p>The remembrance was quite too much, and one
fit of laughter followed another, strangely interspersed
with groans of pain, from the soreness of
the muscles. That merry laugh was at all times
most contagious; the men quickly crowded round,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
joining in it without asking any reason, and we
bade fair to have the scene of yesterday re-enacted.</p>

<p>To preserve gravity was quite impossible, there
was something so irresistibly ludicrous in the whole
affair, but I felt that it must be stopped.</p>

<p>“Corning! this will never do; you must control
yourself; you will be ill; and besides, you are disturbing
our sick men.”</p>

<p>“I think, Miss &mdash;&mdash;,” said he, with a violent
effort at composure, “if you won’t take it hard, if
you’d just go away; if I didn’t see you, I might
get quiet.”</p>

<p>“Certainly I will. I won’t ‘take it hard,’ at all,
and I will come back when you are quieter.”</p>

<p>“Oh! please no! Oh! don’t come back; if you
do, it’ll be as bad as ever again.”</p>

<p>The idea was quite enough; and the last sound
I heard, as I withdrew my mirth-inspiring presence,
was another of those clear, ringing laughs. How
I longed to have the same effect upon the poor
fellows in another ward, where I had vainly racked
my brain for many days, to call up even a faint
smile on their depressed and weary faces. I sent
everything over to the sergeant’s ward through
the day, not risking my dangerous presence there;
and even at night judged it better not to go over
to say goodbye, although it was Saturday night,
and my duties for the week were over.</p>

<p>When I came again, my merry friend had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
returned to his regiment, and that had been our
final interview. I have often wondered since, how
(if ever) we should meet again? Whether that
last laughing parting will linger in his mind, or
whether its memory shall have been crushed out
by the stern realities of war?</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;The problem has been solved. To our amazement, the
week after the Gettysburg fight, Little Corning walked into the
ladies’ room at the hospital, fresh from the field&mdash;or rather, anything
but fresh. Tattered and battered, soiled and moiled; his head tied
up, and looking very much, on the whole, as though he had been in
an Irish row. He had been wounded in the temple by a shell; but
not dangerously, and had hastened to “his old home,” as he called
it, as soon as he arrived, although to his great regret, as well as ours,
he had been placed in another hospital.</p>

<p>We welcomed him warmly, and were too full of his danger and
our own&mdash;his escape and our own, to revert to past days for more
than a word. He had not lost his old bright spirit, and when we told
him how pleasant it was to have our old friends for our defenders, his
eye sparkled, and he said, “Yes; I felt all the time I was fighting
for you.” And thus we met again.</p>

<h2 id="GAVIN">GAVIN.</h2>

<p>How sadly and how strangely we misjudge our
brother! We walk daily by his side, and receive
the cold exterior as a type of the inner life, forgetting
that hardness, sternness, and repelling reserve,
may be only the crust of the crater, hiding the
lava beneath. How comes it that, when, in our
own case, we are all so well aware that,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Not ev’n the tenderest heart, and next, our own,</div>
<div class="verse">Knows half the reasons why we smile or sigh;”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">yet, we will not believe in the secret sufferings of
others? Instead of seeking to win the unstrung
instrument back to harmony, by the tender touch
of loving sympathy, we mete out precisely the
measure meted to us; oppose coldness to coldness,
hardness to hardness, reserve to reserve, and thus
a wall is built up between us, and all hope of influence
is gone. We need more trust in, and more
charity for, each other. Woe to the sick soul,
suffering and sorrowful, its sickness only shown
by the petulant word, the rude retort, the outward
expression of inward wretchedness,&mdash;woe to such
a soul, I say, were it left only to man’s tender
mercies. Most mercifully it is not. Infinite Love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
breathes balm upon it. Infinite Compassion soothes
it. When shall we even begin to imitate the one, or
strive to attain to the other?</p>

<p>These thoughts were called up by a keen sense
of the injustice of my own judgment, in a special
case, only discovered this very day.</p>

<p>A sunny, bright afternoon. Our men are all
improving, none dangerously ill; the most of them
have sought the yard, to walk, to smoke, to sing,
or play at such games as cannot be carried on
in-doors. Everything has a more cheerful aspect
than usual. If melancholy and depression are
infectious, so, happily, are mirth and gayety; and as
the chorus of one of our favorite army songs rings
out on the air, I find myself joining in it, as I
spring up the stairs, two at a time, on an errand.
Scarcely noticing where I am going, I suddenly
stumble upon something on the stair.</p>

<p>“Why, Gavin, can that be you?”</p>

<p>Dashed upon the floor, his face buried in his
hands, his whole attitude denoting utter despair,
he does not even move or notice my question.</p>

<p>While I am standing, looking and wondering, let
me give you a little knowledge of him, as he appears
in the wards. Some time since I was much
struck, on coming to the hospital, by the soldier
acting as guard at the door. His erect and military
bearing, well-made figure, and broad chest, with
the certain “je ne sais quoi” of a gentleman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
rather impressed me, as he lifted his cap and
saluted as I approached.</p>

<p>“Who is our gentlemanly guard to-day?” said I
to M., on entering our room.</p>

<p>“Just come; a fine-looking fellow, isn’t he? I
have just been finding out his history. He is terribly
reserved, but I have made out that he is a
Northerner who went to the South to settle; was
impressed, sorely against his will, at the time of
the breaking out of the war; was taken ill, and
allowed, as he was useless, to come here to see his
mother, who was also ill; he, of course, never
returned, although he had letters from his Colonel,
which he showed, first offering him a Lieutenancy,
and then a Captaincy; but he prefers, he says, to
be a Private in our own army, to the highest
position in theirs.”</p>

<p>“Well?” said I, as she paused.</p>

<p>“That’s all; he told me nothing more; but that
as soon as he came North he enlisted, was taken
sick in camp, and sent here.”</p>

<p>“His history, then, is still to hear,” I said; “he
hasn’t accounted for his interesting melancholy, or
the mournful expression of those large, dark eyes
which strike you the moment you look at him,
and yet there is something about him&mdash;a sort of
dark look&mdash;which I don’t altogether fancy.”</p>

<p>“Oh! you want to make up a romantic story for
him, do you? Well, find it out, if you can; I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
told you all that he would tell me, and yet, I confess
I was struck with his language; it was certainly
much above that of most of our men here.”</p>

<p>Weeks passed by, and as Gavin was not sick
enough to need care, we had little to do with him,
and that little did not encourage us to go further.
Often a word of greeting, in passing, will call forth
something more, but his cold, forbidding manner,
joined to a certain distant politeness, so repelled
me, that I resolved to let him alone; and yet I
felt sorry for him, for I could not fail to notice his
unpopularity among the men. He walked alone,
mentally and physically, and seemed to desire no
intercourse with any one.</p>

<p>One morning I found him gloomily seated in a
corner of the ward, apparently unconscious of
everything around him.</p>

<p>“What a terribly long face,” said I, trying to
rally him; “you will never get well till you learn
to laugh.”</p>

<p>“To laugh!” said he, with intense bitterness;
“then I am invalided for life. Little enough is
there on earth to laugh about, I think;” and rising
hastily, he brushed past me, and left the ward.</p>

<p>“I don’t like that Gavin,” I said to M., “there’s
something so dark and hard about him; I can’t
make him out.”</p>

<p>“Ah! no story yet? I thought he was to have
a romantic story, with his interesting dark eyes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>“Story! He never opens his lips to any one;
and unless he shall need something, I have almost
determined never to open mine to him again.”</p>

<p>Such was the man whom I have left all this time
lying upon the staircase. Knowing as I did that
whatever his faults might be, intemperance was
not one of them, I once more address him; he
evidently has not heard me before, for, starting
up hastily, and forgetting his usual politeness, he
exclaims, petulantly, “I thought I could be to
myself here, at least.”</p>

<p>“So you can, as far as I am concerned; I merely
came up stairs on an errand, without an idea that
you were here; but another time when you wish
to secure perfect privacy, I should scarcely advise
you to choose a staircase.”</p>

<p>“It matters little,” said he, sitting down on the
stairs, resting his elbows on his knees, and burying
his face in his hands, “one part of the world or
another; it’s all the same; dark enough to wish
to be well out of it.”</p>

<p>“Gavin,” said I, sitting down on the stair beside
him, “do you remember that you told me how
terribly your back ached from carrying your knapsack
and blanket on that long march?”</p>

<p>A dull, uninterested assent.</p>

<p>“What would have been most welcome, when
the pain became intolerable?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>“To unload, of course;” his head still buried in
his hands.</p>

<p>“At times, in the long march of life, I have borne
a heavy, moral knapsack; and when the pain from
its weight became intolerable, no words can tell the
relief of unloading, and sharing the burden with
some loving heart, with whom it was as safe and
as sacred as with myself. Your heart, just now, is
aching worse than ever did your back; might it
not ease it to try the experiment?”</p>

<p>He raised his head quickly; fire enough in those
eyes then.</p>

<p>“Ease it!” he said; “doesn’t it feel every day
and every hour that it must burst, unless I tell
what I am suffering? I walk among the men
here, and they pass me as cold and stiff, when,
God knows, I’m on fire inside; I’m burning up,
burning up, here,” added he, pressing his hand on
his brain.</p>

<p>This was enough. The buckles were unstrapped,
the burden would follow.</p>

<p>The first thing that roused us was the tap of the
drum for supper. The long hours of that sunny
summer’s afternoon had slipped by, as I listened
to a story, which, in Victor Hugo’s hands, would
be worked into a romance quite as thrilling as
anything he has ever penned; whilst in mine it
must remain forever,&mdash;a deposit sacred as the
grave. My object was accomplished. With a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
smile, he rose&mdash;the first I had ever seen on his
face&mdash;saying, “You were right about that moral
knapsack; my heart feels lighter than I ever
thought it could again.”</p>

<p>“And you will do as I say?”</p>

<p>“I will try.”</p>

<p>“And you will try too, won’t you, to remember
my first advice, some time since, and learn to laugh
a little more?”</p>

<p>“Indeed I will; and it seems as if it might be
possible now, but let me tell you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Nothing more to-day,” said I, laughing; “I
must refuse any further confidence;” and running
down stairs to our room, I was complimented upon
the promptitude with which I performed an errand.
No matter, thought I;&mdash;if one sad soul has found
comfort in pouring out the bitter sorrows of a life,
the hours have not rolled by in vain. Are we not
all responsible for each day, nay, for each hour, as
it passes? Not alone for the right use of time in
improving our own souls, but for the manner in
which we act upon others. Influence! The language
scarcely holds a more solemn word,&mdash;the
mind scarcely receives a more fearful thought!
How has this power been exerted? We all possess
it in greater or less degree. We all shall have to
render an account for the use or misuse of such a
terrible talent.</p>

<p>Time was, when, to my mind, it seemed only

<h2 id="CHRISTMAS_AT_THE_USA">CHRISTMAS AT THE U.S.A.
HOSPITAL, &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;.</h2>

<p>I promised, when we parted, dear C., that you
should have some account of our Christmas doings;
but the busy days have slipped by, till now, without
my finding a moment to redeem that promise.</p>

<p>You know how we are all occupied at that time;
but no matter how much there is to be done, in
these days “private interests” have a different
signification, and demand attention.</p>

<p>The morning of Christmas Eve, therefore, found
&mdash;&mdash; and myself on our way to the hospital. With
that ready interest which, with her, always rises to
meet the emergency, even at the busiest moments,
she has offered to go with me and help us in our
work; and you know how it doubles my pleasure
for her to do so. Several of the ladies have agreed
to meet here to-day; some for the purpose of
superintending the cooking for the Christmas dinner,
plum-puddings, etc.; others to make and put
up the greens for the Christmas decoration; we, as
you may suppose, are among the latter class. Our
quiet ladies’ room is quite a scene of bustle this
morning; the ladies in charge for the week carrying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
on, or attempting to carry on, their usual
duties; others flying in and out for various purposes;
green wreaths strewing the floor, and vain
attempts are being made to twist them into some
available shape.</p>

<p>This confusion will never do. Nothing can be
accomplished in this way. Let us go into one of
the wards, where it is quiet; and soon we find
ourselves seated by the stove, endeavoring to form
a green sentence by covering the letters with moss
and ground pine; they have been nicely cut for us
by the genius of the hospital, and we are pressing
into our service all the men who can sew, or rather,
all who say that they can, which is sometimes quite
a different affair.</p>

<p>But before we begin, we must go and speak to
poor James, who has been so ill; he is actually
sitting up; but how pale and weak he looks, and
what a languid expression, as he smiles! He tells
us that he hopes to be in the dining-room to-morrow,
and in a few days to start for home. Ah! James,
that photograph so carefully concealed beneath
your pillow, peeps out occasionally, and we all
know that you left a two weeks’ bride to serve
your country.</p>

<p>He has been suffering from fever; but worse
than this, he is subject to epileptic fits, which he
had hoped were cured; but hard life and exposure
have brought them back, and he has had several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
very severe attacks since he has been here. His
gentle, winning manner has made him a general
favorite, and we are all glad to see him better. He
begs to have his chair moved up to our circle, where
he can, at least, look on, while we work; and he is
always sure to find plenty of ready and willing
hands to do any service that he needs.</p>

<p>But our work must not stand still; and lo! at
this crisis, we find ourselves without implements.
We had supposed we were simply to twine and
festoon wreaths, instead of which, or rather, in
addition, we find the green must be sewed on to
those thick book-binders’ board letters. Oh! why
were they not pasteboard, and why have we no
thimbles? But these are not the first wounds we
have received in the service of our country; so, as
we have a few needles, never mind, let us do our
best; and, as our number is increasing,&mdash;one after
another coming up “to see the fun,” and being at
once enlisted in our service,&mdash;no doubt we shall
accomplish the task.</p>

<p>The men, who are always ready to help us, are
specially so to-day, when the bright spirit of the
season seems to communicate itself to all.</p>

<p>Is there not something singularly striking in
thus preparing to hail the birth of the Prince of
Peace in the midst of an army hospital, where we
are surrounded by all the dreadful effects of war?
Surely in no other spot, save the field of battle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
itself, could we as fully appreciate the priceless
blessings contained in that Title.</p>

<p>Those who cannot sew, aid us in other ways.
One of our lieutenants prefers to collect the little
bunches of green, and hand them to me to sew on,
rather than try his hand at sewing himself; as he
is busily engaged at this work, one of the men, in
passing, laughingly rallies him on his occupation.</p>

<p>“Pretty work for a commissioned officer!”</p>

<p>“To oblige a lady, Horstman, is never beneath
any officer, no matter what his rank. General &mdash;&mdash;
himself will tell you that!”</p>

<p>This from me,&mdash;a word by the way,&mdash;very sure
that no matter what assertion I cover by that name,
it will be received by him for truth. There is something
very beautiful to me in the pride and heartfelt
love which the men so often express for their
generals. It is this feeling of trust and confidence
in their leaders which is one of the most important
elements of success, and upon which victory itself
often depends.</p>

<p>Ah! here comes M. We have been wondering
where she could be, and why she did not appear.
Her hands full, as usual, and stopping for a Christmas
Eve greeting with each man, as she comes
along. And see who she has brought in her train!
Men and boys laden with green wreaths; more
still? we shall have quite a bower; and look at
that great tree; where can that have come from,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
and what can she mean it for? It has been given
to her, she says, and we may use it exactly as we
like best; therefore &mdash;&mdash; suggests that it shall be
a Christmas tree for James, who has just announced
his intention to hang up his stocking, and she proposes
this in its place. We all take it up as an
excellent joke, and declare he shall have it. He
seems to enjoy it too, and smiles with that sweet
smile, which I am sure first won his young wife’s
heart, though I should be sorry that she saw it now,
with that weak, languid eye and pallid brow; we
must put a little color into those cheeks, before we
send him home. Having nothing else to do, this
busiest day of the whole year, &mdash;&mdash; promises to
supply all the needful, for dressing the tree, when
she returns from dinner, says goodbye, and leaves
the men all in high spirits.</p>

<p>The work goes briskly on; some of the men
have got tired and left us, but most of them are
faithful still, especially my friend there,&mdash;that tall
Yankee, with his crutches laid at his side. He is
a New Hampshire man; and, with true Yankee
perseverance, has never moved since he concluded
to try his hand at “greening letters,” as he calls
it. He “calculated he could do that as well as
anything else, though he had never tried before,”
and wonderfully has he succeeded. Many a merry
laugh rings out, as the different ones hold up the
results of their work to know if we have an idea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
“what that letter is intended for?” and truly we
often find some difficulty in recognizing them, but
trust their position in the sentence may be more
suggestive than when they stand alone. It is tough
work, and I am almost inclined to agree with one
of the men, who, as he puts the last stitch to his
work, starts up, exclaiming:</p>

<p>“Well, any man that can do that work, is fit to
go back to his regiment; I’ve done nothing like it
since I left the Peninsula.”</p>

<p>As we are hurrying on, to meet the constant
demands from the dining-room, “Can’t you give
us an E?” “Isn’t that A done?”&mdash;a quiet little
man at my side turns to me, and says, in an under
tone:</p>

<p>“No one thinks of the poor fellow who died here
this morning,” pointing to the bed directly back
of the spot where our merry group is gathered.</p>

<p>“Died here! To-day? Who? When?”</p>

<p>“Just about a couple of hours ago. A man you
never saw; only brought in a few days since.”</p>

<p>Could it be possible that here, where we had all
been so full of mirth and gayety, but a few hours
since, on this very spot, on this Christmas Eve, too,
a soul had passed from earth&mdash;from its vigil here&mdash;to
keep the Festival&mdash;where? None knew, and
none can ever know, till the Awful Day, when
“the secrets of all hearts shall be revealed.”</p>

<p>There was a special sadness about this death. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
found, upon inquiry, that the case had not been
considered a serious one; that the man had even
spoken of being at home on New Year’s Day; that
the ladies had brought him a drink that morning,
which they had prepared for him; and scarcely
half an hour later, the wardmaster, in passing, had
been struck by his appearance, went up to him, and
found him quite dead. Apparently he had died
calmly and without struggle; this seemed more
probable from the fact that those in the nearest
beds, even, had no idea of it; but there was a
loneliness about that passing which I could not
forget.</p>

<p>Had he felt the dark cloud coming ere he entered
into its shadow? Had he longed to speak&mdash;to call&mdash;and
had no power? Had he yearned to send one
last message&mdash;one parting word of love&mdash;to those
far-away dear ones? We may not know; and if
a tear moistened those bright greens, as they lay
almost upon the spot where he so late had been,
was it not a type of earth, and of the constant
mingling of earthly joy and sorrow, from which
we may never escape long as we linger here?</p>

<div class="verse">Fair and foul fortune forever are blending;</div>
<div class="verse">Sunshine and cloud have the skies for their range.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I have dropped my work, and am dwelling sadly
on these thoughts, when I see one or two start up,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
and rush over to James. What is it? They are
lifting him from his chair, and placing him upon
his bed. Ah! it is one of those terrible fits; and
see, four men are holding him down. Here comes
the doctor; let us move away all this work, and
keep him quiet. Is it our fault? Have we tired
him by our noise, and thus brought it on? Oh no!
the doctor is consoling; he does not at all attribute
it to us; he has them often, only he must be kept
quite still; and goodbye to all hopes of his Christmas
dinner in the dining-room to-morrow. The
usual remedies are applied, but it is a severe attack,
and leaves him utterly prostrated.</p>

<p>We all repair to the dining-room, and here is,
indeed, a scene of bustle and confusion. Ladders
against the wall, men putting up the half-finished
sentences, festooning the green wreaths, hanging
the flag in graceful folds, so as to dispose its bright
colors to the best advantage amidst the greens,
hurrying in and out on various errands, and busying
themselves about one scarcely can tell what,
only all adding to the general confusion and excitement.
Can any one wonder that no sad impression
can continue where there is so much to turn the
attention and divert the mind? We are conscious
ourselves of its influence; and, of course, men, in
whom the feeling is not a deep one, must be much
more open to it.</p>

<p>But here is &mdash;&mdash;, with all her promised parcels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
for the Christmas tree; how sorry she is to hear
of poor James’ fit; but we decide that it will be
best to make the tree for him, and have it placed at
the foot of his bed to-morrow, to atone for the loss
of the dinner; not to-night, the doctor forbids all
excitement at present.</p>

<p>And now, here is the tree, but how shall we plant
it? Some suggest one mode, some another; but
none take it in hand, till our ever-obliging Corning,
wardmaster of our first ward, appears; prompt to
do, and ready to act, he wastes no time in words,
but bears off the tree, and soon returns with it
firmly planted and ready for service. Thank you,
Corning; what a satisfaction there is in being so
promptly and pleasantly served. And now we
have hands enough. &mdash;&mdash; unfolds her treasures,
and wondering eyes and busy hands are soon
occupied with them; and ere long the tree stretches
out its green arms, laden with golden glories of
gilt balls, soldiers in every conceivable costume,
pocket mirrors, which may yet look upon more
warlike scenes than those they now reflect,&mdash;in
fact, decorations of all sorts, suspended by red,
white, and blue cords, and glittering gaily in the
gas light. Ah! here is an addition; thank you,
Lawrence; those bright red apples, which he has
just washed and polished, will have quite a fine
effect, as he is hanging them among the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
miscellaneous specimens which this wonderful tree
produces.</p>

<p>We are all satisfied and delighted with it, but the
great drawback is that poor James cannot see it,
now that it is done; but Price, his wardmaster and
faithful nurse, has promised to lift it in, and place
it at the foot of his bed, in the morning, and we
know that he never neglects a promise.</p>

<p>The Chaplain is to hold a Christmas Eve Service
here, this evening at seven o’clock; so we are anxious
to have everything in order; and really, it all
looks very nicely, and we regard it quite complacently,
as we take a final survey of our day’s work.
That star, which &mdash;&mdash; brought with her, covered
by kind hands at home, shines out beautifully,
surmounted by the green cross; and our Lectern
holds up its head, quite proud of itself in its
Christmas vestments.</p>

<p>But now, we really must wind up, for the night
has come; and with mutual good wishes for to-morrow’s
enjoyment, we say good-night.</p>

<p>As for the day itself, I can give you little account
of that, as, of course, I could not be present; but
the dinner was described to me, in glowing terms,
by those who were.</p>

<p>The turkeys, the pies, the plum-puddings; the
toasts that were given and drunk with “three
times three” in beer, generously given for the
purpose,&mdash;in fact, everything seemed to have passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
off “a merveille;” but the best part of the whole,
was the orderly manner in which it was conducted&mdash;not
a single case reported for the guard-house.
This pleased us especially, as it seemed to prove
that our efforts for the men’s enjoyment had been
attended with no bad results, and to make the
remembrance of our Christmas of 1862 one of the
bright memories of our hospital experience.</p>

<p>May God grant that ere we hail its dawn again,
those now in rebellion may have returned to their
allegiance, and thus enable us to proclaim a blessed
peace throughout the land. But there is something
first. Before Peace must come Prayer. We need
Prayer; the nation needs Prayer.</p>

<p>Do not point me to the little band of people or
parishes, where the Daily Offering is made,&mdash;where
throbbing hearts, and souls yearning for the safety
of their loved ones, daily kneel before God’s altar,
and in lowliness and penitence send up that pleading
wail, which seems as though it must pierce the
very Heavens, and cleave a pathway to the mercy-seat:</p>

<p>“O, most Powerful and Glorious Lord God, the
Lord of hosts, that rulest and commandest all
things; Thou sittest in the throne, judging right,
and therefore we make our address to Thy Divine
Majesty, in this our necessity, that Thou wouldest
take the cause into Thine own hand, and judge
between us and our enemies.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>And again:</p>

<p>“Hear us, Thy poor servants, begging mercy,
and imploring Thy help; and that Thou wouldest
be a defence unto us against the face of the enemy.”</p>

<p>Most thankful am I for this, and for all that we
have, little as it is; but I am now looking at our
country as a whole.</p>

<p>We know the South to be wrong; we know
ourselves, or rather, our cause, to be right. If,
then, we have right, truth, and justice on our
side, why do we not succeed&mdash;why have we not
succeeded?</p>

<p>Is it not that we have been&mdash;we are&mdash;a sinful
people, pluming ourselves upon our powers, priding
ourselves upon our prosperity, till we have come to
look upon the fair beauty of this land, lavish in its
loveliness, as a possession which is our right, and
not as a loan, for the use and enjoyment of which
we are bound to return the offering of grateful
hearts?</p>

<p>Is it not that we have gone on in a suicidal career
of extravagance, luxury, and dissipation, which
has finally brought its own punishment upon us?
Sorely did we need humbling, and sorely have we
been humbled. Bitter has been our lesson, but
bitterly was it needed. The thought will sometimes
arise, would that the trial had come from
foreign foe; would that friend had never lifted
hand against friend, nor brother against brother!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
Had that grand rising, at the sound of Sumter’s
wrong, which swelled throughout the North&mdash;had
it, I say, but thrilled through our whole land with
a mighty throb, till, with one heart and hand
united, we had joined to defend that Flag, so
treacherously assailed, where is the foe we should
have feared to face&mdash;where the enemy, which,
humanly speaking, we might not have conquered?</p>

<p>But so, the lesson had been lost. We had but
gained further food for pride, further motives for
self-glorification. The medicine would but have
increased the disorder, the remedy added to the
disease. We must acknowledge&mdash;we must recognize
the Chastening Hand which is dealing with us.
Where is the victory which has ever yet, as a
people, sent us to our knees? Where the defeat
which has ever yet been attributed to any but
secondary causes? Want of reinforcements, want
of supplies, want of suitable weather, want of skill
in the commanding officers,&mdash;any and every want
but the true one.</p>

<p>We send our men forth wanting the one weapon,
which, springing from its scabbard, and flashing in
the bright sunlight of Faith and Trust, must insure
success. It is the Sword of Prayer.</p>

absorbing interest at the present time. Forgive

<p>The stormiest day of this stormy winter. Hail,
rain, and snow seem to have formed a precious
triumvirate to take possession of the day, “vi et
armis,” and claim it for their own. I know not
whether it is a certain perverseness of nature, or
a desire to overcome difficulties, which leads me to
prefer such blustering, battling days, to more serene
ones; whatever may be the cause, the fact will
account for my finding myself, on this particular
morning, seated on the kitchen table, before the
hospital fire, carrying on a <em>warm</em> discussion with
one of the men, on the merits of Ruskin, as I dried
my dripping garments. A chance word led to a
quotation by him from one of Ruskin’s works, and
we immediately “opened fire” in more senses than
one.</p>

<p>I found him a man of keen intelligence, self-made,
of course, but a great reader, and quite
familiar with a higher style of literature than we
usually look for here. Doubtless, in his far-away
home, grander halls have echoed to the praises of
the great Art-teacher of the nineteenth century,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
made by more appreciative critics; but I very
much question whether he has ever had more
earnest, zealous, enthusiastic admirers than the
two that day met, before that kitchen fire, on the
shores of another continent.</p>

<p>As I walked through one of the wards, a little
later, I said, in passing, “You are better to-day,”
to a man who had been suffering from such a severe
attack of erysipelas in his head, that his eyes had
been closed for many days. The enormous swelling
of his head, added to his long, matted beard and
thick, tangled black hair, had given him a fierce,
brigand sort of air, which was far from being
dissipated by the appearance of a pair of large
black eyes, opened to-day for the first time since
I had seen him in the hospital.</p>

<p>“Better,” said he; “but oh, lady!&mdash;”</p>

<p>He turned his head away, shaking it sadly.</p>

<p>“What is your grief?” said I, sitting down beside
him.</p>

<p>“My little ones, my little ones! Where are
they? Five weeks, dear lady, have I lain here,
and no word have I had from them.”</p>

<p>A long, and most sorrowful story followed, of
which the main points are these: a Spaniard by
birth, he had come to this country in search of
employment, settled in Philadelphia, married, and
for several years was prosperous and happy, till
his wife fell into bad habits, wasted his earnings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
and brought them to utter poverty and wretchedness.
On one occasion he had gone to a neighboring
town on business, and on his return found their
comfortable home broken up, the house and furniture
sold, and his wife and their three little ones in
a poor hovel, in one of the worst parts of the city.</p>

<p>No one who did not hear him, can imagine the
pathos with which he described his little girl’s
illness, with all the fervor of his warm Spanish
nature; his care of her; his walking the floor with
her night after night, her little arm around his
neck and her head upon his breast; “for you see,
lady, it was worse than if she had had no mother.”
His love for her seemed to amount to a passion;
his boys, he said, were “nice little fellows,” Juan
and Henriquez; but evidently his feeling for them
was nothing in comparison with the idolatry
lavished upon his little Rosita, as he called her,
a child of four years old.</p>

<p>“I lie here at night,” said he, the large tears
rolling down his cheeks, “and think if I could just
once have that little hand in mine, that little head
upon my breast, it would cure me faster than all
this doctor’s stuff, far away faster.”</p>

<p>From what he told me, I gathered that he had
enlisted in the war in despair; and during his
absence his wife, for her outrageous conduct, had
been considered insane, and taken to the insane
department of the almshouse, where she then was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
the children having been taken to board by a
woman in the neighborhood of their house. He
had been unable, as he had said, to hear anything
about them, and feared they were ill, especially his
darling Rosita.</p>

<p>“Lady, dear lady, could you, would you see
about them for me?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said I; “if it is possible, I will go
at once; but I must first know where they are.”</p>

<p>“You will?” he said, “You really will?” with
an expression of wondering delight; and then, as
though the very thought brought peace, remained
perfectly still, apparently musing upon the idea.</p>

<p>“But,” said I, “you do not tell me where to find
them.”</p>

<p>“No &mdash;, &mdash;&mdash; Street.”</p>

<p>I started, and shook my head. “That is impossible;
I could not go there.”</p>

<p>“Impossible!” he said, his voice amounting
almost to a shriek. “Don’t say it! Go, dearest
lady, go! Nothing could hurt you; God will protect
you; oh! go. I would kneel to you if I could
rise.”</p>

<p>“I do not want you to kneel to me; I would go
at once, but it would not be right.”</p>

<p>“Not right! not right!” he said, with utter
despair in his tone. “Oh! then what on earth
can be right?” and covering his head in the bed-clothes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
he groaned as though from the depths of
his soul.</p>

<p>As this is no autobiography, it matters little by
what train, either of reasoning or of cars, I reached
the spot where I stood, an hour later; nor, for the
same reason, shall I be more particular in my description
of what followed, than is necessary for
my narrative. Suffice it to say, a certain account
of “St. Margaret’s court,” in the matchless poem
of Aurora Leigh, was before me, stereoscoped into
life, never again to be mere word-painting.</p>

<p>A little, low, blue frame building; the outer
room, into which you step from the street, is apparently
a small green grocer’s shop. Strings of
suggestive-looking sausages hang in ropes from
the top of the door and window; pieces of black-looking
material, yclept bacon, by courtesy, are
piled up among barrels of gnarly green apples,
evidently not gathered from the gardens of the
Hesperides; baskets of eggs&mdash;which I am very
sure no tidy hen would ever confess to having
laid&mdash;crowd the little, low, dirty counter, behind
which stands the live stock of this interesting
apartment. And certainly the object upon which
my eyes first rested did not belie her “entourage.”
It has been well said, that the soul makes a harmony
for itself in its surroundings, and thus character
is developed and declared. If so, how beautifully
the unities were here preserved; for why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
should we not have the unities of dirt, as well as
those of elegance? Doubtless that Celtic soul found
as much enjoyment in seeing all around her in such
perfect keeping with her own appearance, as Beau
Brummel ever did in the appointments of his famed
boudoir. I should almost have hesitated to ask a
question of this curious production of nature,&mdash;something
between a crone and a hag, with coarse
Irish features, loose dress, hair hanging down, and
apparently guiltless of any tending of either comb
or brush since she had attained maturity, which
was certainly not yesterday,&mdash;had she not herself
opened the way.</p>

<p>“Get out of this, will you, <em>Jewann</em>, don’t you see
the lady?” addressed to a dirty, commonplace-looking
little urchin, of about nine years old, who
sat tilting himself forward and back upon the edge
of one of the aforesaid barrels, with infinite peril
to life and limb. This rather remarkable name,
with her felicitous rendering of it, seemed to me
circumstantial evidence, and I gathered courage
to ask, “Are you the person who takes care of
José’s children? I have come to see them for him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, miss, walk in; we’ve but a poor place, as
you see. Rosy, come speak to the lady.”</p>

<p>But it needed not the name; as soon as my eyes
rested on the child in the corner, I was satisfied
that this was her father’s darling; and who could
wonder at his love! Rarely have I seen a more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
perfect specimen of “beauty unadorned”&mdash;the
rarity of the jewel enhanced and thrown out by
the coarseness of its setting. She lifted her eyes
from the floor, on which she was playing, to stare
at the unwonted visitor&mdash;large, liquid, Spanish
eyes&mdash;with that expression of love and confidence
in them which seldom outlives childhood. Those
tangled black curls, her father’s pride, were almost
hidden beneath a common, coarse, little worsted
hood, in which she had stuck four or five chicken
feathers, which gave her a sort of picturesque air;
a large stain of the dirt in which she was living,
rested on one cheek; but it seemed merely a
shadow bringing out the bright tints beneath.</p>

<p>“Come here, Rosy, I say, and speak to the
lady; she’s just seen your pappy.”</p>

<p>At that word she sprang up, and came wonderingly
to my side, never taking those eyes from my
face.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said I; “I have just come from him, and
he wants so badly to see his little Rosita; what
will she send him?”</p>

<p>In a moment her little arms were tightly clasped
round my neck, as I bent down to speak to her, and
those rosy lips were pressed to mine, in a warm,
loving kiss.</p>

<p>Quite aware that this mute message, eloquent as
it was, could scarcely be delivered with satisfaction
to any of the parties concerned, I drew one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
feathers from her cap, and said, “Shall I tell him
his little girl sent him this?”</p>

<p>A bright, beaming smile, was the only answer I
could extract. The woman now began a piteous
story of having to provide for them&mdash;no money,
etc., etc.,&mdash;backed by her husband, who appeared,
pipe in his mouth, from some back den, evidently
hoping to extort funds; but when they discovered
that I was in possession of all the facts, with
regard to the support of the children, they seemed
to find it useless to proceed; and finally agreeing to
my request that one of them would take the children
to see their father, I left the direction, visiting
days, etc., with them.</p>

<p>Once more I stood by that bedside, which I had
so lately left, with that deep groan ringing in my
ears.</p>

<p>“Do you know what that is?” said I, holding up
the feather.</p>

<p>No answer from the lips, but the eyes said,
plainly, “I don’t know, and I don’t care.”</p>

<p>I varied the question. “Do you know where
that came from?”</p>

<p>He started, pierced me through with those keen
black eyes, then said, seizing the hand in which I
held it with a grasp which secured my remembering
him for many days, “You didn’t?&mdash;you couldn’t?&mdash;it
isn’t?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” said I; “I drew it from your little girl’s
cap; she sent it to you with her love.”</p>

<p>His grasp relaxed; and, burying his face in the
pillow, he sobbed aloud. I waited, thinking he
would recover himself, but no word came; hard,
heavy sobs, only increasing in violence, shook the
bed, and I was frightened at the terrible emotion
I had called forth. Deeming it best not to notice
it, I began quietly to give him an account of my
trip, dwelling on the least exciting parts of it, but
all of no avail; apparently he did not even hear
me, and I saw that he was getting entirely beyond
his own control.</p>

<p>What was to be done? Here was indeed a
dilemma. He was exciting the attention of the
whole ward; it was within half an hour of inspection
when the surgeon in charge goes his rounds
through the wards,&mdash;what would he say? Was this
the way that the ladies excited their patients?
But beyond and above all, he was injuring himself;
and with the tendency to inflammation in his head,
I dreaded the effect of such strong excitement, and
yet all I said seemed but to increase it. Suddenly
it occurred to me that (something on the principle
of “similia similibus curantur,” little as I usually
admire the practice) perhaps by evoking another
feeling equally powerful, I might calm him; and
knowing that no one, be it man or woman, will
ever submit quietly to blame without an attempt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
at self-justification, I changed my tactics at once,
and said:</p>

<p>“How it is possible, that a father, who has one
grain of love for his children, can permit them to
remain one day, or hour, in such a den as that, is to
me a marvel that I cannot comprehend.”</p>

<p>The rûse was a perfect success. Starting up in
his bed, with flashing eyes, he said, with a vehemence
which at another time would have frightened
me:</p>

<p>“How cruel! I couldn’t help it, and you know
I couldn’t; haven’t I told you how it breaks my
heart, night and day, to think of them there, and
I tied here and can’t get them away?”</p>

<p>This was all I wanted; he poured forth a volley
of eager self-defence, and ere it was half over, my
mind was quite relieved about him, and I had the
satisfaction of seeing him in a short time quite
composed, and anxiously seeking to know every
particular of my visit. He would not be content
without hearing over and over the most minute
details, all the time stroking and patting the
feather, as though it were indeed the little one
it symbolized.</p>

<p>The following Sunday, as I passed through the
ward to attend service, I saw the three children
on the bed; the two boys seated at the foot, and
the little Rosita lying on his breast, with that
dimpled arm round his neck, as he had wished.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
He smiled as he saw me, and held up the feather.
I never saw him again. I heard, the next time
that I came to the hospital, that news had been
brought him of his wife’s death at the almshouse;
he had been allowed to go out on a pass, but had
failed to return, and nothing further had been heard
from him.</p>

<p>Poor José! We shall, in all probability, never
meet again on earth; but I can never think of him
without finding, in his history, the most powerful
proof that “these men <em>have</em> feeling.”</p>

<h2 id="ROBINSON">ROBINSON.</h2>

<p>“War is an unmixed evil; look at it as you will,
it is, it must be, an unmixed evil!”</p>

<p>This, in an indignant tone, from one, standing at
my side, gazing at one of its saddest results.</p>

<p>“An evil, I grant,” said I; “unmixed I deny.
War and its attendants have a grand side. Do
not start, and look so reproachfully at me; were
we standing on another spot, and were the circumstances
different, I would tell you all I mean; but
let it pass.”</p>

<p>We were in no mood for argument then, and the
subject dropped; but it recurred frequently to my
mind, and the more I have dwelt upon it, the more
I am convinced (your pardon, dear speaker!) that
such a statement is not, cannot be true. War has
its compensations, its beautiful compensations; and
I very much question, whether, if the statistics
of the good deeds, the kind, warm, large-hearted
actions, could be registered, as are those of crime,
we should not find that those performed in times
of war, greatly overbalance those in times of
peace. Great crises call forth and compel great
deeds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>Where is the battle-field since Sumter’s sad
surprise, which cannot boast, not one, but many
Sir Philip Sydney’s, with the earnest “Take it; thy
need is greater than mine?” Magnanimity need no
longer be confined to the field of Zütphen, and each
child be taught the story as though it stood alone.
Where the hospital where we may not see something
of sublimity in the beautiful forgetfulness
of self, the untiring devotion with which plain,
poor men watch, night after night, by a dying
comrade,&mdash;a stranger till those walls had made
them brothers? Where the home, high or humble,
which fails to show the brave-hearted wife, mother,
daughter, or sister, giving for her country a life far
dearer than her own, to danger and to death? Is
there no moral grandeur, no moral heroism here?
A sad soul, so struggling with, yet surmounting
sorrow; so sending forth her sure support and
stay, then turning calmly and quietly to take up
her lonely cross and bear the burden of daily life,
by virtue of such act reaches a spiritual elevation
which times of peace could rarely, if ever, witness.</p>

<p>I see the laugh&mdash;I hear the cutting remark,
“Such a <em>woman’s</em> view!” but I know these things
are true, for I have witnessed them; and, be it
remembered, that ridicule is not reasoning, nor
satire always sound sense. Never can I listen to
this statement, that “War is an unmixed evil,”
without longing to combat it; and added to that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
but this very morning, the same belligerent desire
was excited in my mind by reading an opinion,
somewhat dogmatically asserted, that, “In these
days, Apollo must give place to Mars.”</p>

<p>“Not so,” I answered then; “not so,” I answer
now. Apollo never gathers in a heavier harvest&mdash;never
stores stouter sheaves, than those mowed
down by the chariot wheels of the God of War,
as he dashes onward in his headlong career. Ask
the world, since creation’s dawn, and she will tell
you that Apollo clings to Mars; and if he ever
“gives place,” it is only that he may follow on the
fiery track of his great leader, sure of grander
opportunities in the waxing and waning of one
moon, than a life-time of peace could give.</p>

<p>And even granting (which I never will) that
Apollo pauses in his course&mdash;that his lyre “lingers
o’er its lays”&mdash;are not the daily deeds of our loved
land, at this moment, prouder poems than this
continent has ever yet produced? Where can we
find such stirring strains, such ringing rhythm,
such burning ballads, such lyric lays, such sublime
sonnets, such ever-during epics, as these times of
ours call forth? Is not each soldier a poet in his
way? And shall his verse have the less power, for
that it is set to martial music? Shall it touch our
hearts the less? Rather, shall not every chord
vibrate ten thousand times the more, for that the
pages on which it is written are the fair fields of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
our own dear country; its pen, the sword; its ink,
the heart’s blood of our brothers?</p>

<p>But I have wandered wide of my mark. I seated
myself to note a simple story, of one of that ever-growing
army who have nobly given their young
lives to their country.</p>

<p>I have made allusion before to my whistling
friend, Robinson, who was brought to the hospital
at the same time with our poor Darlington, from
the same regiment, and wounded in the same battle,&mdash;that
of “Fair Oaks.” His left arm was terribly
shattered, just below the shoulder, and injuring the
shoulder-blade; and for a long time his case was a
very critical one, requiring the most close and
constant watching. He was entirely confined to
his bed for many tedious weeks, and yet I know
not why I should apply that term to the time so
passed; for they were certainly never “tedious”
to us, although we felt great anxiety for him, and
we never had any proof that they were so to him.
Patient and uncomplaining, the only sign he gave
of suffering, save the contraction of his brow, was
the constant effort to whistle away the pain, and
his moans in his sleep. There was always something
inexpressibly sad to me in these moans; it
seemed as though the body were compensating
itself, during sleep, for the powerful restraint
imposed upon it during waking hours.</p>

<p>I have rarely seen greater unselfishness in any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
one. During his illness, it was all-important to
keep up his strength, for as the wound began to
heal, one abscess followed another, and kept him
much prostrated; we therefore tried to tempt his
appetite in every way; and often, when I have
brought him some delicacy, he has pointed me
to some one near him, with the words, “Please
give it to him; he cares for such things more than
I do.”</p>

<p>His love for his mother, and anxiety to spare her
all unnecessary suffering on his account, was very
beautiful, and attracted me to him from the first.
His weakness was so great that he was utterly
unable, for a long time, even to feed himself, and
of course, could not write. When I offered to do
so for him, he declined, saying, that she knew,
through a friend, that he was here; and that the
sight of a strange hand, with the conviction that
it would bring that he was too ill to write for
himself, would be worse for her than to wait for
a little while.</p>

<p>One day, some time afterwards, I came to his
bedside and found a paper lying there with a few
unmeaning scratches, as I thought, upon it; he
held them up to me.</p>

<p>“The best I could do.”</p>

<p>“What were you trying to do?” said I; “did
you mean that for drawing?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>A look of intense disappointment passed over
his face.</p>

<p>“I was afraid so,” said he; “then it would
frighten her, as I thought. I meant it for my
signature, and I’ve looked at it, and looked at it,
and hoped it didn’t look as bad as I thought, at
first; but if you ask what I’m trying to do, when
you see it, the game’s up, and it’s no use.”</p>

<p>I assured him that such a signature would be far
stronger proof of the real state of the case, than
any letter I could send telling the facts, and giving
the reasonable ground for hope which we now felt.
But he still preferred to wait; and ere very long
we found, by pinning the paper to the table, to
keep it firm, he could execute a tolerably legible
epistle. The weeks rolled on, and, by slow degrees,
he regained his strength; his bright, hopeful disposition,
even temper, and uniform cheerfulness,
were great aids to his recovery; and we watched
his improvement with great satisfaction, and at
last had the pleasure of seeing him able to be up,
and even out, for a short time.</p>

<p>He came to me, one morning, in our ladies’
room, saying, “Miss &mdash;&mdash;, would it be troubling
you too much, to ask you to write to mother?”</p>

<p>“Brought to it, at last!” said I. “Why do you
ask me now, Robinson, when you have refused so
often before, and can write for yourself?”</p>

<p>“That’s just it; she won’t believe what I say;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
thinks I’m fooling her, and pretending to be better
than I really am; and has an idea they’re going to
take my arm off, and I’m keeping it from her; and
I thought if you’d just write, and tell her it wasn’t
coming off, she’d be sure to believe you.”</p>

<p>“Sure to believe a stranger in preference to her
own son, Robinson? Does that tell well for the
son?”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am, I think so; she knows you could
have no object in deceiving her; while the thing
I care most for in the world, is to keep her from
fretting, and she knows it.”</p>

<p>There was no combating this reasoning, and in
a short time I received a beautiful answer to my
letter, well written and well expressed, confirming
all that Robinson had told us:&mdash;That he was the
youngest son, and had always been carefully and
tenderly brought up; that he had two brothers, the
only other children&mdash;one had gone to Texas, before
the breaking out of the rebellion, and never having
heard from him since, they feared he had been
pressed into the rebel service; fortunately she had
never heard, and I trust, now, never may hear what
Robinson had told us,&mdash;that, while pressing on, at
the battle of Fair Oaks, over heaps of the enemy’s
dead, he saw an up-turned face on the field, wounded
or dead, he knew not which,&mdash;that face, he said, he
never could mistake&mdash;it was that of his brother!</p>

<p>We tried to convince him that this was most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
improbable&mdash;that his imagination was excited at
the time, and that the dread that such a thing
might happen had been “father to the thought;”
but in vain; we never could persuade him to the
contrary; and yet, whether from a doubt in his
mind, or the dread of the pain it must cause, he
never, as we afterwards found, had made any
allusion to the subject in his letters home.</p>

<p>One morning, after he had been able to be about,
and even out for some weeks, I was surprised, on
going into his ward, to find him in bed again.</p>

<p>“Why, Robinson, I am sorry to see you there!
What have you been doing?”</p>

<p>He hesitated, twisted the end of his coverlet, but
made no answer.</p>

<p>“Nothing wrong, I’m very sure of that. It
wasn’t your own fault, was it?” said I, fearing
he thought I doubted him, as so many of the
relapses here are caused by excess, the moment
the men are able to be out, and I well knew there
was no such danger here.</p>

<p>He looked up at me, at once, with his clear,
honest eyes, and said, “Yes, Miss &mdash;&mdash;, all my
own fault; but I thought <em>she</em> worried so&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Your mother?” I questioned.</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am; and if I could just slip my arm
into my coat-sleeve long enough to have my picture
taken, she’d see it was better, and it would set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
her mind at rest more than all the letters I could
write.”</p>

<p>So to satisfy this mother’s heart, the poor wounded
shoulder had been forced into its sleeve, giving him,
as it did, several weeks of added suffering and confinement
to his bed. Can any one wonder that such
a man should have won his way to our hearts;&mdash;or
at our regret, when we found he was to be transferred
to another hospital, at some distance from
the city? We thus lost sight of him for many
months. Several times when I asked after him,
at our own hospital, I was told that he had been
there but a short time since; sometimes the week
before; sometimes only the day before; but it so
happened that we never met. His wound, they
told me, was far from well, varying very much;
some days giving hope that it would heal, and
then bursting out again. I had received many
and urgent letters from his mother, before he
left us, begging me to use all the influence I could
bring to bear, to have him transferred to a hospital
near his home; (this was, of course, before the
present order on that subject had been given) but
on applying to the surgeon, I found that he considered
his wound far too serious to attempt the
journey, and that Robinson so fully agreed with
him, that I wrote the poor disappointed mother
to that effect, trying to console her with the hope
of restoring him to her, ere very long, perfectly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
cured. The winter slipped away; the pressure
of present hospital duties and interests had almost
crowded out all thoughts of Robinson, when I am
surprised, one sunny April afternoon, to receive a
note from one of our lady visitors, telling me of
Robinson’s extreme illness, and that it is scarcely
supposed he can recover.</p>

<p>An hour later finds M. and myself driving rapidly
out to the hospital where he now is; and here we
are at the gates; how shall we enter! Ah! we do
not now fear a guard with a bayonet, as we should
have done some time since; and fifteen minutes
more suffices for all the necessary “red tape” connected
with admittance, and we are at the door
of Robinson’s ward, listening to the wardmaster’s
answer to our question:</p>

<p>“Yes, ladies, walk in; but he won’t know you;
he’s too low, and he’s flighty all the time.”</p>

<p>“Won’t know us!” Robinson not know us! We
cannot believe that; but see! he is leading the
way; and we follow to a bed where lies a man
tossing restlessly, and talking, or rather muttering
to himself in an indistinct tone; his bandaged
shoulder and arm resting on a pillow, for an operation
has been performed&mdash;a large piece of bone
extracted&mdash;and the result still doubtful. Doubtful?
No; too certain; that face is enough. Poor mother
in your western home, you can never look upon
your boy, till you meet at the final Bar, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
presence of your Judge! God in his mercy grant
that it may be to spend a happy eternity together!</p>

<p>And yet, as we stand, we find ourselves almost
doubting whether this can really be our merry,
laughing, whistling Robinson. Little hope, indeed,
that he will recognize us, but let us try.</p>

<p>“Robinson, do you know me?” He starts, and
in a moment the vacant gaze changes into one of
his old bright smiles of recognition.</p>

<p>“Know you! Why shouldn’t I know you? How
long it is, Miss &mdash;&mdash;, since I have seen you,&mdash;and
you too,” added he, stretching out his hand to M.;
but even as he spoke, his expression changed, and
his mind wandered again.</p>

<p>And this was the end of all our care&mdash;this the
result of so many weary months of suffering. He
seemed pleased at our coming, and would answer
any direct question, but could not sustain a conversation
of even a few moments. We found our
old friend, “handsome Harry,” of concert memory,
who had been transferred at the same time, established
here as Robinson’s devoted nurse, although
entirely unable to move without crutches. He told
us that the surgeon had told him that morning,
that if his family wished to see him, he had better
telegraph for them at once. Robinson heard us,
and catching the word “telegraph,” said quickly,
“Don’t telegraph; father’s poor, and he might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
come on; I’ll be better soon, and get a furlough,
and go out to them.”</p>

<p>“But, Robinson,” said I, “you are very ill; perhaps
you may not be better, and you would like to
see your father.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I’m very ill&mdash;they said so to-day;
but I think I’ll come round soon.”</p>

<p>The next moment he was on the field, and evidently
going over the fatal “Fair Oaks” fight.</p>

<p>His friend Harry told us that it had been his
most earnest desire and longing to see his father;
and that he had urged him, some days ago, if he
should be worse, to let them know at home. I
therefore wrote the telegram on his table, and we
drove to the office on our return to the city, that
no time might be lost.</p>

<p>I was detained at home for the two succeeding
days; but some of our ladies went out to see him
each day, as he was a general favorite; one lady
going in a pouring rain, although she knew that
she would have nearly a mile to walk after leaving
the cars; their report of the case was most unfavorable.
On the third day, the Rev. Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, who had
been a most constant and faithful friend to Robinson,
in our hospital, went out with me. When we
arrived, we found him in a terrible state of excitement;
he had been talking, and was now almost
shrieking, and dashing himself from side to side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s no use speaking to him, to-day,” said the
wardmaster; “he don’t know anybody.”</p>

<p>But once again I tried it, and once again he
extended his hand, and repeated my name, and
then said, “And Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, how very kind in him
to come!”</p>

<p>I sat down by him, and tried to soothe and calm
that dreadful restlessness; his mind was too much
gone for words, I only gently stroked his brow and
fanned him. “I am out on the water; out on the
water!” was his one cry, from a low tone, ascending
till it amounted almost to a scream. Truly he
was “out on the water,” and where was compass
or chart for the final voyage? Those words, with
the constant repetition of his brother’s name, were
the last I ever heard him utter. The only moment
of calmness I noticed, was when Mr. &mdash;&mdash; knelt
at his bedside and repeated those soul-soothing
Prayers, from the “Visitation of the Sick.” He
attempted no conversation, for we well knew
Robinson was in no state to bear it. We had felt
from the first, that Prayer <em>for</em> him, was all that we
could offer; not <em>with</em> him, as his intervals of consciousness
were merely momentary. His father
had not yet arrived, and there appeared little hope
that he could now do so, in time, as he was very
much lower than on my last visit, and evidently
sinking. As our presence could give him no comfort,
we left him with heavy hearts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>When I reached there the next day, I found that
an order had been given prohibiting all admittance
for visitors to his ward, as the surgeon thought that
Robinson had been excited by those he had seen
the day before, but that his father had come, and
that we could see him; he had arrived that morning.</p>

<p>There are few things connected with this hospital
work which I recall with more pleasure than the
simple, earnest gratitude of this bronzed and
weather-beaten old man, for the trifling kindnesses
which we had been able to offer to his boy. There
was something about him altogether so real, so
honest, genuine, and sincere, that one could not
help feeling drawn to him at once. He was a
rough, plain, Western man, primitive in the extreme;
but no one could listen to him without
the consciousness that a warm, true, noble heart,
beat beneath that uncouth exterior.</p>

<p>Had the telegram been a day later, he could not
have reached here for nearly a week longer. The
train, which only runs on certain days, left the
morning after he received the news; he had
travelled night and day, making every connection,
and performing the journey as rapidly as it could
be done.</p>

<p>His boy, he said, had recognized him, and he was
pleased to find him better than he had hoped for.
He thought with care he would get well now, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
he was going at once to telegraph the good news to
his wife.</p>

<p>We were thunderstruck; how could he be so
deceived? For although we had not seen Robinson
that day, we well knew he was in a condition
from which he could not rally. It seemed therefore
no kindness to allow his mother to be tortured with
false hope, and we earnestly represented (hard as
it seemed to do so) that the surgeons did not look
for any improvement; but all in vain,&mdash;he had seen
sickness&mdash;he had seen doctors mistaken before now&mdash;his
boy was going to get well; so he accompanied
us to the telegraph station, and sent his message.
That evening I was told some one wanted to see
me, from the &mdash;&mdash; hospital, and on going out, was
met by the words, “Miss &mdash;&mdash;, my boy’s gone, my
boy’s gone!” and a burst of sobs, which seemed
as though it must shake that poor old frame to
pieces.</p>

<p>He had scarcely left, in the morning, to send his
hopeful telegram, when the change took place, and
Robinson breathed his last just as his father reached
his bedside. The blow fell heavier, as we had feared,
from the strong hope he had persisted in entertaining,
and even then it seemed as though he were too
much bewildered and stunned to realize fully what
had occurred. There was something inexpressibly
touching in the grief of that poor, bowed-down old
man, shattered as he was, too, by hard travel and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
loss of rest; and yet I hardly knew how to comfort
him, or to answer that sad appeal, “How can I go
back to his mother without him?” Deep grief
must ever bear with it a reverence of its own, and
this seemed something one scarcely dared meddle
with.</p>

<p>He said the funeral was to take place the next
afternoon, and begged that the ladies who had been
so kind to him would be present for his mother’s
sake; he thought it would comfort her to know it.
I readily consented, and promised to inform the
others.</p>

<p>He rose to go, and drawing a little paper from
his pocket, said, “I thought maybe you might care
for this; it is a lock of my boy’s hair, which I cut
off for you, and I thought his mother would be
glad to know you had it.”</p>

<p>I expressed my feelings in a few words, which
seemed to soothe and gratify him.</p>

<p>That poor mother seemed never out of his
thoughts; and again and again would he repeat
that piteous question, “How can I go back to her
without him?”</p>

<p>But he need not have feared; that mother’s heart
was anchored on the Rock which alone can withstand
the storms of earth. Listen to but one
sentence from her first letter (to one of the ladies,
who had been a kind and constant correspondent,)
after that sad return.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>“At first it seemed I could not bear it. My bright-faced,
joyous boy&mdash;my sunbeam! But soon came
the thought, how short the journey would be for
me to go to him, and that my sunbeam would now
shed its ray upon me from the sky, to light my
path onward and upward.”</p>

<p>It would be of little avail, to go into the dreary
details of that dreariest afternoon. Touching in
the extreme did it seem to see the little band (for
the ladies willingly agreed to the request to be
present) take their places as mourners, with the
father; mourners in reality, though so lately
strangers; mourners, for we claimed a right to
grieve; for was it not, as I have said, a young
life, given for our country as well as his?&mdash;for the
one common cause, which forms so strong a bond
between all loyal hearts?</p>

<p>A heavy, pouring rain added to the general
gloom; the only comfort came from the words
of our Burial Service, which must always fall with
blessed balm upon the sorrowful soul. It was
performed at his father’s request, and with the
permission of the surgeon in charge, by Robinson’s
kind and true friend, the Rev. Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, to whom I
have alluded before.</p>

<p>It was a long, long time ere I could forget the
face of that broken-hearted old father, as&mdash;everything
over&mdash;he stood at the door, as we drove off,
leaving him lonely and desolate among strangers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
He was to start that night alone, in the rain, on
his sad, homeward journey, and seemed to long to
keep us with him to the last; and how we longed
to stay to comfort him! But we must say goodbye,
and with a long, warm grasp of that rough hand,
we parted, and one more hospital sorrow was over.</p>

<p>Brave, gentle, heroic heart! The aching limb,
the suffering frame, the strained, excited nerves
are stilled forever. Robinson sleeps in a land of
strangers; but the turf that covers that “soldier’s
grave” will be moistened and kept green by the
tears of those who can never forget that bright
example of noble unselfishness, and beautiful
patience under severest suffering and trial.</p>

<h2 id="THE_RETURN_TO_THE_REGIMENT">THE RETURN TO THE REGIMENT.</h2>

<p>A bright, sunshiny week. Moral sunshine, I
mean; for like St. Peter’s, at Rome, our hospital
may be said to have “an atmosphere of its own”&mdash;our
brightness or dulness being in a great measure
dependent upon the state of our patients. Deaths,
or very severe cases of illness, naturally have their
effect in casting a shadow on everything around;
but at present, most fortunately, we have nothing
of the kind; and our principal grief (though in a
very mild form) has been from the daily partings
caused by the return of our men to their regiments;
which, from some unknown cause, seems to have
been the sole business of the last few days. The
“Hegira” has been going on steadily through the
whole week, and we have been busily occupied in
helping to stow treasures into impossible spaces in
knapsacks, slipping in some little contribution of
our own, to call up, perhaps, a smile of surprise
when opened far from here; in putting up lunches
for the travellers&mdash;for it has happened that some
of our brave boys have fainted on the way from
exhaustion produced by delay in getting their
meals; therefore, by the surgeon’s orders, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
are always provided when they start&mdash;and finally,
in bidding them “Goodbye, and God speed!”</p>

<p>This returning to regiments has amounted to an
epidemic this week; the contagion is spreading
rapidly, and it is very plain that Dame Example
has, in this case, been exerting herself for good.
She has taken some of our chronic cases by the
hand, lifted them out of bed, and made them feel
that effort and firm resolve will do more for them
than yielding to the languor of a slow convalescence.
One may ask, “Is it, then, at the option
of the men, when they shall return to their regiments?”</p>

<p>“Most certainly not.”</p>

<p>“Does not the surgeon decide that point?”</p>

<p>“Most certainly he does.”</p>

<p>The surgeon of each ward makes out his list of
men fit for service, and hands it to the surgeon in
charge, who in his turn examines the men so
reported and returns them to their different posts;
but, as we all know how much the mind has to do
with the body, men who have seemed quite unfit
for duty, often, under the stimulus of one of these
departures, rouse themselves, make an effort, and
find that a little exertion was the only thing needed
to fit them for their work. But, on the other hand,
this strong desire sometimes carries them too far;
a case in point occurred this morning.</p>

<p>“Why, Shaw, my man! out of bed to-day? I’m<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
glad to see you up; you’ll soon be off, with the
other boys.”</p>

<p>This, from the cheerful voice of one of our surgeons,
to a man who, from a long fever, had been
too feeble, for many months, to do more than sit
up in bed for a short time.</p>

<p>“That’s just it, doctor; Pat’s going to-day, and
I can’t let him go without me. I think I could
bear it, maybe. Won’t you let me try?”</p>

<p>I noticed a slight look of surprise on the doctor’s
face; he pressed his finger on the man’s pulse, was
silent for a few moments, and then said, kindly:</p>

<p>“Perhaps you can go with the next lot; stay
out of bed, to-day; try to walk a little about the
ward; eat more, and I’ve no doubt you can go
back soon; but we should have you back on our
hands, were we to send you to-day.”</p>

<p>“But Pat, doctor? You see we’re from the
same town; he’s young,&mdash;only a slip of a boy&mdash;and
I promised his mother I’d see to him. I did
let him get hit, to be sure, but it wasn’t much to
signify; my fever was a good bit worse; we were
brought here together, and I’m bound to leave
when he leaves, whether I can shoulder a musket
or not.”</p>

<p>How glad I was that it happened to be just that
particular surgeon to whom he made his appeal;
for it must be admitted, even in this pattern hospital,
that skill and sympathy, power and patience,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
knowledge and kindliness, are not always combined;
but in this instance I was very sure the decision
would be given (whatever it might be) in a manner
which could not offend; nor was I disappointed.</p>

<p>“Well, my friend, if you had told me that you
had kept Pat from getting hit, I might have taken
it into consideration, whether, for the sake of Pat’s
mother, it might not be my duty to return a man
to his regiment who can’t walk across this hospital;
but as, by your own account, you let him get hit,
I think you’ll have to trust him without you, and
wait here till you’re a little stronger;” and kindly
patting him on the shoulder, he laughingly turned
off.</p>

<p>Poor Shaw! It was a sense of duty&mdash;certainly
not any feeling of ability to go&mdash;which led to the
proposition; for as the hope departed, his strength
went with it. He attempted to rise from his chair
at the side of the bed, tottered, and would have
fallen; but I saw it, sprang forward, caught him,
and threw him backward on the bed, knowing I
had not strength to support him.</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean to knock you down, Shaw, though
it looks a good deal like it,” said I, as there was a
general laugh, amongst those nearest to him, who
witnessed the proceeding.</p>

<p>No answer. The effort had been too much for
him&mdash;he had fainted. I called an orderly to bring
me water quickly, and bathed his temples from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
the cologne bottle in my pocket, but he did not
revive.</p>

<p>“What’s the fuss?” said one, coming up behind
me.</p>

<p>“Miss &mdash;&mdash; has knocked the breath out of Shaw,
that’s all.”</p>

<p>“And he’s knocked the color out of her; she’s
whiter than he is.”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk; get me some water,” said I, hastily.</p>

<p>“La! miss, you’re not really minding, are you?
He always has them turns when he tries to sit up;
and he’s gone a good bit, and we don’t mind, he’ll
come round; he’s been fretting at little Pat, there,
going without him, and wanted to go back to his
regiment with him. Fine hand at a march,
wouldn’t you be, eh, Shaw?” said he, as the
latter opened his eyes.</p>

<p>With rough kindness, he put his hand under
Shaw’s head, raised it, and held the water to his
lips. Shaw roused himself, looked round, and
seemed gradually recalling what had occurred.</p>

<p>“Drink, old fellow! and you’ll soon come round.
It’s my advice to you, to stay in your bed till
you’re fit to get out of it; you ought to be ashamed
to make a lady look like that.”</p>

<p>“Be quiet, Gilman,” said I; “I’m not frightened
at all; I’ve seen worse sights here than a fainting
man; it was only the effort of suddenly throwing
him backward, which I felt for the moment.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>But I have no doubt Gilman’s rebuke was of far
more service to Shaw than my ready sympathy
would have been; for it roused him, and diverted
his mind from his own sorrows. He did not at all
know what he had done; but was profuse in bewildered
apologies for some unknown wrong to
me, which he seemed to feel convinced that he
had committed; although the “how, why, or what”
was wrapped in mystery. I soon satisfied his mind
on that point, and then, more guardedly, touched
upon “Pat;” promised to see to his comfort as far
as possible; give him good advice as well as good
food,&mdash;little doubting which would be the more
welcome,&mdash;and finally, promising Shaw to return
as soon as they were off, I hurried away, fearing I
was already too late to say goodbye.</p>

<p>These partings are brighter things for those who
go, than for those who remain; it is as true here,
as in other cases, that “Les peines du départ sont
pour celui qui reste.” The bustle, the excitement
of getting off, the hope of service, the prospect of
change of scene, make the going something pleasant,
even to those whose patriotism is not at fever
heat; while, for those who remain, the sight of
others going, the consciousness of their own inability
thus more painfully forced upon their minds,
the sense of confinement, make the hours after one
of these departures a somewhat sad affair, and we
have to exert all our powers to restore cheerfulness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>A bustling scene meets me at the door of our
room. A busy group is crowded there; some
kneeling on the floor, strapping knapsacks and
blankets; some jumping into the well known blue
overcoats, which have enjoyed a profounder rest
than their owners have done since their entrance
into the hospital; some settling their caps well
down over their eyes, as though cap and “caput”
were never again to part company; while some
(yes! they really have,) have begun to say goodbye.
M. calls me, and I hurriedly enter.</p>

<p>“They’re going; you’ll be too late to see them
off.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah, boys! Come on. We’re off. Goodbye,
ladies! We won’t forget you. If ever the rebs
come here, send for us; we’ll stand by you, and
fight for you, too.”</p>

<p>“Goodbye, ma’am, if I get hit I hope they’ll
send me here.”</p>

<p>“We’ve had a bully time here, and we’re proper
sorry to go back. ‘Salt horse’ and ‘hard tack’
will come pretty hard, after all your nice little
messes. Goodbye, ladies, and thank you kindly
for all you’ve done for us.”</p>

<p>Such are the parting words, rough it may be,
but coming from the heart, and therefore far more
valuable than the elegant insincerity of more
polished partings. But as character is shown in
every action of life, we may easily detect the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
difference of nature even in their mode of saying
goodbye. One comes forward with frank smile,
and hand extended, his whole soul beaming from
his honest eyes; he is glad to have known you,
somewhat sorry to leave you, but so very happy
to be off, that there is little room for any other
feeling; and you take leave of him with satisfaction,
sure that his contented nature will adapt
itself to whatever circumstances may surround
him. Another comes up really sorry to go, but
thinking it beneath a soldier’s dignity to show
feeling; he therefore tries to assume a perfectly
indifferent air, but like everything assumed, it sits
ill upon him, and we all know that in his heart
“sober Sam,” as the boys nickname him, is more
sorry to leave us than he cares to acknowledge.
A third shocks our patriotism by openly declaring
he don’t want to go; he don’t care to fight, and
he’s sure he’s not fit for it either. Ah! Bob, isn’t
it that you love your own ease a little too well?
The field may not be quite so comfortable as it is
here, but it is unworthy of a soldier to mind such
trifles as want of bed, and occasional want of food.
But Bob doesn’t think so, and whatever his other
faults may be, he is honest in declaring his opinions.
But here come the others, and we have but a few
minutes more.</p>

<p>“Goodbye, Brown; take care of yourself; we
shall miss you when we want our errands done.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>“Goodbye, Williams; don’t forget your promise.”</p>

<p>“Goodbye, Simpson; what shall we do without
you for a wardmaster?”</p>

<p>“Goodbye, John; come back with shoulder-straps,
and God bless you!”</p>

<p>That bright young face looks still brighter, as he
says, “Why, Miss &mdash;&mdash;, that’s what they all say to
me; I’ve been through the wards bidding the boys
goodbye, and they all say ‘God bless you, John!’
Why do they say that to me?”</p>

<p>I could have told him without much difficulty
why that genial, sunny nature, so full of bravery
and beauty, of life and love, had won its way to the
hearts of “the boys,” and called forth that warm
“God bless you.” The Prayer from so many hearts
seems to have won its answer; God has blessed
him and guarded him from harm. Nobly has he
fought, and the shoulder-straps are won. Promotion
on the field “for distinguished services,” has
been gained; and we now have the pleasure of
directing our quondam “Private” John’s letters,
to “Captain” John, of the Army of the Potomac.
But as he is pressed on in the crowd, before I can
answer his question, I notice a pale, quiet youth,
always retiring and gentle, standing at my side
with a hesitating air.</p>

<p>“Well, George, you’re off too; I won’t forget
you, and you mustn’t forget me.”</p>

<p>He still stands, and still hesitates, saying nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>“Can I do anything for you, before you go, or
perhaps after? Can I help you? tell me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am, you can help me. If you would
just let me shake hands with you, I think it would
help me on the battle-field, to remember it. I saw
the others come up, but somehow I didn’t dare to,
and I was so afraid I would have to go without.”</p>

<p>Poor George! Not many of the men are so
troubled with modesty. Such a little boon to be
asked for so earnestly! one, too, which half the
men claim as a right in parting.</p>

<p>“You didn’t think, George, after all our talks, I
could have let you go without shaking hands with
you, did you? No, my boy,” said I, holding out
my hand; “but I will do what will be more likely
to help you on the battle-field, pray for you; and
now, goodbye.”</p>

<p>He grasped my hand, and as he held it, a hot
tear fell on it; he seemed shocked, dropped it, and
rushed from the room into the crowd waiting at
the door to start. The signal sounded, and they
were gone.</p>

<p>“God go with them!” said an earnest voice at
my side.</p>

<h2 id="A_VISIT_TO_THE_WARDS">A VISIT TO THE WARDS.</h2>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">U. S. A. Hospital.</span></p>

<p>And so you really wish, dear C., to take that
long-promised trip through the wards of our hospital?
Most happy shall I be to escort you; and
I promise, ere we start, to use every endeavor to
prevent you from going any deeper than you wish
into the “horrors of hospital life.” You shall not
see an open wound if I can help it;&mdash;do not imagine
that I have forgotten the effect upon you of the
sight of that man’s arm the last time that you
were here; and yet it was your own fault, for it
was your expression of interest in him and his
wound which led to the display; and we, hardened
creatures that we have become, were not aware of
your feelings till the harm was done. But put
yourself under my guidance to-day, and I will
pick out only the choice specimens. Yet no! I
cannot do that exactly, for, in answer to a charge
brought against me here a few days since, I have
promised to select the worst cases&mdash;the <em>morally</em>
worst cases, I mean,&mdash;in the hospital, to show my
friends. What was the charge? you ask. Nothing
very heinous, to be sure. A friend, to whom I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
very often talked of the hospital and its inmates,
said to one of our medical cadets, as we walked
through the wards:</p>

<p>“Tell me, doctor, is a hospital really the paradise
Miss &mdash;&mdash; represents it? Her soldiers are all perfectionists;
they never quarrel, they never swear,
they never drink, they never gamble; and more
than this, they never get well; they are sure to
die in some romantic way, with an interesting
wife, mother, or sister, in the distance.”</p>

<p>My answer, of course, was a laugh, trusting to
my friend, the cadet, to justify me; but here I
was mistaken. His answer was a mere empty
word of compliment, as to what the ladies made
the hospital, etc., leaving the main question untouched.
I therefore was compelled to take up
my own defence, and assure her that the fact of
my having preferred to dwell upon the interesting
cases, was no proof that the hospital contained no
others; that we all knew that either in or out of
a hospital, our strongest feelings were called forth
by extreme illness and danger.</p>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Like a bruised leaf, at touch of Fear,</div>
<div class="verse">Its hidden fragrance Love gives out.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>More than this, that here, as elsewhere, people
ceased to be interesting when they recovered;
therefore, most naturally, I had not dwelt much
upon such cases as had returned, cured, to their
regiments. I further assured her that I had heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
men both quarrel and swear; had seen them both
drink and gamble within these walls; and that, at
the very moment we were speaking, a special friend
of mine&mdash;acknowledged to be the worst man in the
hospital&mdash;was in the guard-house; a man who probably
interested me more deeply and painfully than
any one here; and whose story, could I tell it, might
thrill her to her soul’s depths; but in this case also,
there was an “interesting mother in the distance,”
whose pale, patient, long-suffering face, mutely
appealing to me from her sweet photograph, must
seal my lips forever upon that sad subject. Because
I had told her that oaths were checked in our
presence, did it follow, I asked her, that they were
never uttered in our absence? Because I had said,
and most truly, that in my whole term of service
I had never heard a rude word, or seen an act of
discourtesy, either to myself or any of the lady
visitors, did it follow that such words or acts never
passed between themselves? Because I had shrunk
from the painful theme of the guard-house and its
inmates, did it follow that it was untenanted? And
finally, triumphantly made her confess that, like too
many amongst us, she had formed her conclusions
on insufficient data, promising, as a reward for her
generosity in owning herself routed, that henceforth
I would reserve the pleasant cases for myself,
and pick out the worst ones for my friends, as they
seemed to prefer them. I tell you this, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
you may understand why I take you, first of all,
to the crossest man here, in preference to the most
attractive and gentle. You do not care to see him,
you say. Oh! yes. For the sake of my promise
I must show him to you, and after that we can
look at pleasanter specimens. He will not hurt
you; it is only that nothing that can be done for
him ever suits him, unless done by the ladies; for
he is no exception to my rule, and is always polite
to the ladies. Amongst ourselves we call him “The
Grumbler,” so entirely that we sometimes forget
his real name. I was amused, the other day, to
hear M. say, as she designated the different saucers
of corn-starch which she was giving to one of the
orderlies, “You’ll remember, now, that this is for
Davis, that for Strickland, that for Jones, and this
for ‘the Grumbler.’”</p>

<p>“For who, ma’am, this last one, did you say?”</p>

<p>“The Grumbler,” repeated M. with perfect unconsciousness,
as she continued to hunt spoons
for the different saucers.</p>

<p>I quietly enjoyed the bewilderment of the
orderly, but said nothing to enlighten him.</p>

<p>“That’s what a good many of them are, ma’am,
when I goes back without enough for all, but I
don’t know which one you mean now.”</p>

<p>M., thus recalled to herself, laughingly explained;
and the idea that such was the ladies’ name for him,
seemed to afford special delight to the poor orderly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
who has doubtless been frequently the victim of
his wrath.</p>

<p>“You’ve hit it this time, ladies; he does nothing
but grumble from morning till night; nothing that
I can do will suit, though I’ve tried till I am tired,
to please him.”</p>

<p>Whether he has confided to him our flattering
name for him or not, I have not yet been able to
discover, but think it not at all unlikely. As we
pass along to his bed, just notice the tables of the
men, and see how carefully they have the “Lares
and Penates” treasured up on them. Pictures
of wife, mother, and sister, little remembrances
carefully preserved; the Bible,&mdash;often the parting
gift&mdash;and once or twice a little toy, which seemed
to keep home fresh in the father’s heart; but one
thing has often struck me with surprise; these all,
as you may see, lie open on the table, but you will
never see the bride elect&mdash;the promised one&mdash;so
exposed; her memory and her face are as carefully
guarded as though she were in danger of being
captured and carried off by storm. I have seen
quite as much reserve and delicacy of feeling upon
this point, as I have ever met with in higher circles.
The story comes at last; but it is often after months
of watching and nursing, when you fancy every
detail of home has been given over and over again,&mdash;it
comes in bashful words and with heightened
color, “I thought I’d like you to know;” or, “You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
won’t mention, will you? But”&mdash;and then comes
confession. Or again, a sudden burst of gratitude
seems to find vent in showing you that precious
one, so carefully hidden all this long time; and a
photograph is mutely placed in your hands, and
of course no <em>woman</em> ever yet said to any picture
so given, “Who is this?” Ah! well. I fear you
are tired, long ere this, of my earnest desire to
prove that the human heart is the same all the
world over, prince or peasant, baron or beggar,
senator or serf; so let us walk on, and speak to
our cross friend.</p>

<p>There he sits, on that bed opposite to us, in the
red shirt, with his arm in the sling; that’s a bad
wound, and I often excuse his irritability, because
he is suffering so much with it, and I know that
the doctor thinks amputation may be necessary.
He is a good-looking man, if he would only smile
and look good-natured, instead of frowning and
scolding all the time. There comes his dinner;
now listen, but don’t go up to him, just yet; if
he sees the ladies, he won’t express his views so
plainly.</p>

<p>Grumbler, loquitur. “Call that my dinner?
Pitch it out, I say, pitch it out, or I’ll pitch you
out! Didn’t I tell you the next time you brought
me that greasy stuff you call soup, I’d report you?
say, didn’t I?”</p>

<p>Down-trodden orderly, rising at last. “Pitch it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
out yourself! The other boys can eat it; I don’t
see why you’re so mighty nice.”</p>

<p>“Mighty nice, indeed! I tell you it’s grub not
fit for an almshouse, that’s what it is.”</p>

<p>Let us go up and speak to him; perhaps the
sight of the ladies may allay his wrath.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, George? what are you
speaking so violently about?”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, ma’am; I didn’t know you
were there.”</p>

<p>“But the whole hospital might have heard you;
and I just want to know, for curiosity, whether
you really referred to that chicken soup, when you
said it was “grub fit for an almhouse?” because,
if you did, I want to tell you that I have just
finished feeding a very sick man with it, and that,
as I tasted it before giving it to him, I thought
how nicely it was made; and that, tired as I was,
I should not object to have a little ordered for
me.”</p>

<p>“It’s that coat of grease on the top, ma’am, that
I can’t stand; it makes me sick, and I’ve told him
over and over not to come near me with it, big fool
that he is.”</p>

<p>“But, George, it’s very easy to remove that; it’s
been standing, that’s all; look here, just take your
spoon, and skim it off; there, see how nicely it
looks below. Do you know I think you’re something
like that soup yourself, crusty and disagreeable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
on the surface, but skim that off, go deeper,
and I don’t believe you’re such a bad fellow, at
heart, cross as you seem!”</p>

<p>“Why, do I seem cross, Miss &mdash;&mdash;? I don’t
mean to be so, only they never bring me what
I want; and this plaguey arm keeps aching so all
the time.”</p>

<p>“That’s just what I thought; and I am sure that
if we could only get that arm better, you would be
a different man. I am sure you suffer with it a
great deal. Try and take this nice corn-starch,
maybe you’ll like it better than the soup.”</p>

<p>“That! Old scorched stuff! You won’t catch
me taking that in a hurry, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Scorched? Why, George, it isn’t scorched.”</p>

<p>“Not scorched, ma’am? No milk, pretended to
be boiled, ever came out of that kitchen yet, that
wasn’t scorched.”</p>

<p>“That, I happen to know, is not so; but just tell
me one thing,&mdash;have you tasted it?”</p>

<p>“Not I, and I don’t mean to; I know it’s bad,
without tasting it.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, George, for your gratitude. We
made that this morning, with our own hands, with
particular care, and put the flavoring in it you said
you liked the other day; it has never been near
the kitchen, and I can answer for it’s not being
scorched.”</p>

<p>“You made it, ma’am? The ladies? Then it’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
the kind I like. I beg your pardon. Billy brought
it in with the dinner, and I thought he got it out
of the kitchen.”</p>

<p>“We sent it to you by Billy; but, if it had come
from the kitchen, wouldn’t it have been as well to
try it, before condemning it so strongly? I feel
much mortified that this lady, who has come to
see the hospital, where we try so hard to have the
food nicely prepared, and delicacies provided for
the men, can go home and tell that she herself
heard one of them say, when his dinner was
brought to him, ‘Pitch it out,’ for it was ‘grub
not fit for an almshouse.’ You ought to be careful
what you say, George, for perhaps you do not
know what is the fact, that the testimony of the
men, with regard to these things, outweighs tenfold
all that the surgeons or the ladies can say. I
constantly hear the remark, ‘Oh! yes. Of course
it is to the interest of the surgeons to represent
that everything is as it should be; the ladies are
proud of their hospital, and of course praise it;
but ask the men,&mdash;they are the ones to tell the
truth about it&mdash;ask them if they are comfortable,
and get what they want; if they are satisfied, be
sure it is all right, and vice versa.’ Now, this lady
has come in, and you know what she has heard, as
the testimony of the only man she has yet listened
to. Is this quite fair, George?”</p>

<p>“Oh! Miss &mdash;&mdash;, I’m very sorry, indeed I am.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
I didn’t mean it, you know I didn’t; only this
plaguey arm, as I tell you, keeps me snappish-like.”</p>

<p>“Well, never mind, I don’t think you’ve done
much harm this time; this lady shall taste both
soup and corn-starch, if she will, and then she
can hear her own testimony that the one is not
greasy, nor the other scorched. Only grumble a
little less next time, and we will forgive you now.
But come, dear C., we are wasting too much time
on one case, and there are so many here that I
want you to see.”</p>

<p>Ah! here comes one of our finest specimens, a
whole-souled, true-hearted man; one whom you
may safely trust, and never fear that you will
find your confidence misplaced, which, I am sorry
to say, is not always the case. You shake your
head, and mean by that, I suppose, that a man
looking as well as he does, certainly might go back
to his regiment. I grant you that he looks perfectly
well, but let me beg you not always to be
guided by appearances here, any more than elsewhere.
Some of those we have supposed best
fitted for service, were really the least able to
bear exertion. I remember a case last winter,
which taught me a lesson on that point. Corning,
one of our men, who was afterwards made wardmaster,
and whom I have often mentioned to
you as one of my favorites, is the one I have in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
my mind. When he first came to us, he was
suffering from a severe kick from a horse, which
had broken several ribs; but after a few months
he appeared so perfectly well, that we used very
frequently to take the liberty of judging, and
wonder why he was not returned to his regiment.</p>

<p>One afternoon, during a violent snow-storm, he
undertook to join one or two of the men in a
game of snow-balls; that evening, when we were
preparing the suppers for the sick men, Corning
failed to appear as usual for his ward, and we
found that the exertion of the afternoon had been
quite too much for him; he was in bed, and for
weeks was not himself again. This showed me
how thoroughly unfit for any but the lightest duty
a man might be, and yet appear&mdash;as our friend here
does&mdash;in good health. “Our Charlie,” as the men
call him, is a general favorite; he was one of our
orderlies, and has just been made wardmaster, and
has proved very popular in that capacity. He has
one of those sunny, genial natures which create an
atmosphere of their own, and brighten every one
who may chance to come within the sphere of their
influence. Poor fellow! he was giving me an
account, yesterday, of rather an unfortunate picnic
which he was at the day before. A party of
the men had obtained passes to go upon one of
those excursions which are so popular here in
summer; he had foolishly taken with him his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
pocket-book, containing thirty dollars (“John
Greenback,” as they irreverently term the paymaster,
having paid the hospital a visit the day
before), which in a very short time he found he
had lost. He had been sitting on the grass, with
a set of men all of whom were known to him
except one, whose appearance he had not liked
when he joined the party; this man, who had
just left them hurriedly, he felt convinced had
taken it. On giving notice to the police, he was
advised to say nothing, but keep a close watch,
and he would probably be able to detect him.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t the money I cared for, a bit, Miss
&mdash;&mdash;,” said poor Charlie, in telling me of it, “but
the pocket-book had <em>that paper</em> in it, and you know
that was more to me than all in Uncle Sam’s
treasury.”</p>

<p>I well knew what “that paper” meant, for it
was through it that we first found out what a true,
loving heart beat in the breast of our bright, frank,
off-hand Charlie. His brother, also in the army,
had been wounded, brought here to another hospital,
and died there while Charlie was here, without
his knowing it. With that thoughtful kindness
which has brought comfort to many an aching
heart during this sad war, one of the ladies preserved
a lock of his hair for his family; and
hearing, after all was over, that Charlie was here,
brought it to him, and gave him all the particulars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
of his brother’s death. No one, who had once
heard Charlie give that account, could ever forget
it; the deep, bitter sorrow, which refused to be
comforted; the unavailing regret&mdash;almost self-reproach&mdash;with
which he wound up, “And to think
I was so near, and never went to him!”&mdash;this
seemed to be more than he could bear.</p>

<p>We always found ourselves more ready to sympathize
with him in his grief, because he entered
into every one else’s interests so warmly, whether
of joy or sorrow. “That paper,” therefore, I knew
contained this precious lock of hair; which, he
told me only a few days ago, he wanted to send
to his mother,&mdash;“all she can ever have of her
boy”&mdash;and had delayed doing so, only because
he wished to give it to the chaplain to send for
him. It needed no words of his, to tell me what
a loss this was to him. Later in the day, however,
as he was walking through the grounds, he saw
the man whom he had suspected, seated under a
tree with a woman,&mdash;who afterwards proved to be
his sister, and to whom, they found, he had given
one-half of the money. Notice was given at once
to the police, who immediately arrested both of
them. On being detected, the man instantly put
a roll of notes into his mouth, and tried to chew
them up; this was speedily prevented by the
policeman, who throttled him and compelled him
to disgorge them. “But,” said Charlie, “I begged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
him not to choke him, as I wanted to hear where
the pocket-book was, much more than to get the
money.” This, however, the man obstinately refused
to return, nor could it be found upon him
after the strictest search. “After telling him what
was in it, too,” continued Charlie, “after begging
and beseeching him by the love of his own mother,
just to give me the pocket-book, and keep the
money (evidently, from what he told me, to the
infinite disgust of the policeman), could you believe
me, that he wouldn’t listen to me, but walked
on, just as if he didn’t hear me? As we went
along, I saw him suddenly pitch something over
a fence at his side; a thought darted into my mind;
over that fence I dashed, and sure enough, down
there in the grass, was my little white paper; and
now they may keep my money, and welcome.” It
seemed to perplex him terribly, where the paper
could have been concealed during the search, or
how the man happened to have it out of the pocket-book;
but such was the fact, just as he related it.
He told me that the police had been at the hospital,
that day, bringing him fifteen dollars,&mdash;half of his
money&mdash;which the sister had confessed that her
brother had given to her at the time, and requiring
him to go and give evidence against the man, which
he was most unwilling to do, having, as he said,
“secured all that he cared for.”</p>

<p>But while I am making a long story of Charlie’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
loss, you are looking eagerly at that bed in the
corner; that poor fellow, who is so pale and languid,
is from Wisconsin; he has injured his spine,
and cannot sit up for more than a few moments at
a time. He is one of the mournful ones, and our
most earnest attempts to cheer him seldom produce
more than a feeble smile. Nothing could convince
you more of the blessing of buoyancy of disposition
and a sanguine temperament, than a short time
passed in one of these hospitals; you see at once
that it carries a man more than half the way
towards cure. But nothing we can do will brighten
poor Granger; he seems gentle and grateful, but
persistently depressed, and that makes us feel much
discouraged about him. You are looking at the
gentleman sitting at his side; yes, it is, as you
think, Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, one of our most valuable aids
here; he has, for many months, been assisting the
chaplain in visiting, reading, writing for, and talking
to the men, and most grateful do we all feel to
him for his services here. No sun too hot, no air
too heavy, through this whole summer, to find him
at his post; and the men repay his kindness with
the warmest attachment.</p>

<p>Look at this man just coming in at the door; it
is poor Cuthbert; he does not belong in this ward,
but he wanders where he likes. His is a sad case.
A bullet struck him on the head, injuring his brain;
at times he is perfectly himself, but usually his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
mind seems quite gone; it is truly pitiable to see
him. His wife and little children are here in the
city; she tells us that he was a most industrious,
faithful workman, before he enlisted; honest and
sober, and the kindest husband. We are very sure
of his unselfishness, for no matter what we brought
him to take, whilst he was confined to bed, his
answer was always the same, “Give it to Bob;”
or “Bob’s wounded, give it to him.” He rejected
everything for himself with these words, fancying
himself still on the field with his friend. We found,
to our surprise, that “Bob” was none other than
young Lieutenant &mdash;&mdash;, well known here, whom he
had been nursing and watching most tenderly till
he had received his own wound. The news of
“Bob’s” death, which reached us soon after we
arrived, would doubtless have been a great sorrow
to him, but the poor fellow never could understand
it; and we begged the men to say nothing about
it, during his sane days, as we all wished him spared
this additional suffering. He will get his discharge
soon, but his poor wife will now have to support
him, as well as her children. Surely a Soldier’s
Home, for those disabled by this war, is one of the
charities most imperatively demanded at present.
I know that efforts are even now on foot to obtain
it, but it is a thing which should, which must, be
pressed. Why pause till we see it accomplished,
and those suffering and thrown out of employment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
for life, provided with a home? Why rest till we
have actually placed within its walls the army who
have returned&mdash;many of them in the prime of life&mdash;maimed
and mutilated, to our midst&mdash;cut off
from all possibility of advancement for the rest
of life&mdash;helpless, and too often hopeless? Shall
we not show them that we can at least appreciate
all that they have done for us?&mdash;that we can, and
will gladly deny self, to give to them the home
which their sufferings and self-sacrifice have so
deservedly won? We need but the earnest purpose
to secure its fulfilment, and I cannot feel that
Philadelphia will ever rest till she has added to her
generous labors in sending men forth, a liberal
provision for the comfort and maintenance of the
disabled, on their return.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Let us pass down on this side, as we go out of
the ward. I want you to look at that man’s eye,
it is so full of bright, keen intelligence and quick
wit. I wish that we had time to talk with him;
but it is such a difficult matter to break off, that,
without an abundance of time, I always hesitate to
begin. The other morning I happened to enter the
ward just as inspection was over; (which, you
know, means the time at which the surgeon in
charge makes his rounds attended by the surgeons
of each ward;) this man beckoned me to his bedside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>“He’s a bully man, that head one, ain’t he?”</p>

<p>Criticism from the men upon any of the officers
of the hospital, be it favorable or unfavorable, is a
thing which we strictly discountenance at all times;
and I therefore said,&mdash;assuming, or, as &mdash;&mdash; says, I
should always say, <em>trying</em> to assume, an air of dignity&mdash;</p>

<p>“You should not speak so of the surgeon in
charge, it is disrespectful; you must remember
that he is as much your superior officer, for the
time, as the colonel of your regiment.”</p>

<p>“Faith! then there’s an act of disrespect I’ll
never pay my colonel. He’s gone to his account,
so we’ll say no more; but not a boy of that regiment
will ever&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>This I could not permit; so I turned at once to
leave him, finding my moral lessons turned against
myself, and that “hæc fabula” didn’t “docet” the
respect I intended.</p>

<p>“Oh! please, miss! don’t go&mdash;don’t be offended! I
didn’t mean it, indeed; I may be rough, but I mean
no offence; I want to tell you why I called him
‘bully;’ just let me, even if you don’t like him.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t that I don’t like him,” I endeavored to
explain, “but that I think you have no right to
criticise those above you. Were I to allow that, I
might, on the same principle, allow you to find fault
with one of the other officers; I never meant that you
should not be grateful for being so well cared for.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s just where it is, miss; it don’t matter
the being cared for; they cared for me in Washington;
but it’s the way the caring’s done. I’ll
just tell you how it is, in this war. We’re all a
set of ten-pins, stood up to have balls sent at us;
along they come, and down we go. No matter,
get another set; but still, it may save Uncle Sam
to mend the broken ones, and use them again; so
the menders come along, pick you up, feel you all
over, and see if you’re worth mending; if so, you’re
patched up, and stood in your place again. I’ve
seen enough of it; but here comes this fellow&mdash;I
beg your pardon, miss, it’s surgeon in charge I’m
thinking you like him called&mdash;and he don’t say
much different from other menders; but it’s all in
his eye&mdash;it says a lot more nor his tongue&mdash;it
says, ‘You’re flesh and blood, you are, poor fellow!
and I’m sorry to see you twisting about with pain
like that, and it’s all a bad business, this same, so
it is.’ Do you think I care what a man’s tongue
says, when his eye says that? I tell you, I feel
better the whole day for one look like that. It’s
my belief that all the talk that’s right from the
heart comes out of the eye, and when men want
to make you believe things not just so, it’s their
tongue they use.”</p>

<p>I did not suggest that it had been remarked, on
the one hand, that “Language was given to conceal
a man’s thoughts;” or, on the other, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
“Countenance and gesture are vehicles of thought,
but their capacity and scope are limited,” as I was
quite sure that he was entirely innocent of any
plagiarism, either of ideas or their expression.
But what a lesson in his words for us all! Here
is a man confined to his bed, suffering acutely, who
tells me that he feels better for a whole day&mdash;for
what? For some kind act to relieve that suffering?&mdash;some
pleasant look, or sprightly game to beguile
his tedious hours?&mdash;or for</p>

<div class="verse">“Kind words, so easy to speak,</div>
<div class="verse">But whose echo is endless?”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>For none of these; but merely for a look&mdash;a glance
of sympathy! Could we realize the priceless value
of such seeming trifles, surely in our intercourse
with our fellow-men, we should be more on the
watch to practice them&mdash;more prompt in their
exercise. It is not that feeling is wanting, in many
cases, but perception,&mdash;the perception of the mode
in which we act upon others; but we must beware
of forgetting our responsibility on this most important
point, and remember that</p>

<p>Look at that man stooping down and playing
with Dick, our hospital pet. A gentleman? you
ask, and I cannot wonder that you do. Every one
who sees him says, “But he isn’t one of the privates?”
He is; but I imagine there is no one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
here more anxious to flourish in shoulder-straps.
He has interested me much since I first met him
here; he was very sick when he came in, but I did
not see him until he was better, and taking his
place as one of the orderlies&mdash;as our rule is in the
hospitals, that convalescents turn into wardmasters
and orderlies, before they are fit for active service
on the field. His deference to the ladies, and
certain little graces of manner, showed birth and
breeding; and I said to M. one day, “That man
was born a gentleman.” I found that she quite
agreed with me, and had been struck by the same
thing. And yet there was an air of dissatisfaction
at times, and a bitterness of expression which I was
at a loss to account for. One morning I had brought
some books to the hospital, and on offering them to
him, amongst others, he told me that he had so
injured his eyes by over-study at college, that he
was unable to use them at all at present. A few
words more, and I discovered that he was a loyal
Virginian, who, on the breaking out of the rebellion,
had left family, friends, and a beautiful home, to
enlist in our army. All his relations were bitterly
opposed to the step; and he told me, with much
pain, that when our army was in the neighborhood
of his home, he had gone there to see his family,
but that they had positively refused to see him, or
even to allow him admittance. I could scarcely
wonder at his depression after this; but it seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
to me that the consciousness of right, in the step
he had taken, should have brought him more content
and peace than he seemed to possess. A few
afternoons since, he came in, as usual, with his
waiter, to carry the supper to the sick men (those
unable to leave their beds) in his ward. I noticed,
as I arranged the plates for him, that he looked
much disturbed, and that his hand trembled.</p>

<p>“King,” said I, “you are hardly strong enough
yet to carry that waiter; you should ask one of the
other orderlies to do it for you.”</p>

<p>I seemed to have fired a mine. Setting the waiter
down upon the table, he burst forth:</p>

<p>“It’s no want of strength, Miss &mdash;&mdash;, but what
would you think if you saw Dr. &mdash;&mdash; and Dr. &mdash;&mdash;
(naming two of our surgeons) playing wardmaster
and orderly in a hospital in the South? My position
was just what theirs is, and I chafe at this menial
work. My blood boils at playing waiter for the
men here; I can’t stand it, and I won’t.”</p>

<p>I looked up in surprise. “What should I think,
King, should I see such a dreadful sight as you
suggest? I can tell you, very quickly, what I
should think. If those gentlemen had, for the
sake of their country, nobly given up every private
tie as you have done, and, by the fortune of war,
had been thrown into a hospital, I should honor
and respect them for fulfilling every duty there
imposed upon them; and I doubt not that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
would do it most cheerfully, as part of the service
their country asks at their hands. I should like
to know, also, whether it is less menial for the
ladies to turn cooks here, than for the men to
turn waiters? I cannot recall that I ever “chafed”
at the “menial work,” or that my “blood boiled”
at cooking eggs, or boiling farina, unless on a hot
summer’s day, when the fire seemed intolerable,
but never, I am very sure, from shame at the
occupation. We go even further, for we act both
cook and waiter. A day never passes that we do
not carry to the men what we have made for
them, to see if they like it&mdash;to know if it suits
them&mdash;or oftener still, to feed them, because they
are unable to feed themselves. Think what a state
of fever-heat our blood should be in at this time,
after two years of such services!”</p>

<p>“But the case,” said he, “is not a parallel one.
Your service, grateful as we all feel for it, is voluntary,
this is compulsory.”</p>

<p>“I thought you were a volunteer, King? When
you enlisted, did you specify just the kind of work
you would do? When your country needed you,
did you limit the aid you offered? What matter is it
to you whether she asks you to fight for her, or to
serve her by ministering to her sick and wounded
members, suffering in a common cause from their
efforts on her behalf.”</p>

<p>“I never thought of it in that light before.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>“Think of it so now, my man; you will be far
happier. That southern blood is a little too hot,
and you have failed to perceive that all work is
dignified and ennobled by the spirit which you
bring to it. Because you are a classical student,
and feel that you have talents and acquirements
which fit you for something higher, you chafe at
this service; but, believe me, the faithful performance
of your duties here, will by no means unfit
you for a command in the field so soon as your
services there shall win for you the promotion you
so much desire. So take up your waiter, and don’t
let your blood boil too much as you go up stairs,
or you may upset my saucers.”</p>

<p>He took my lecture in very good part, and since
then we have been excellent friends. I think, since
he realized that I preferred talking to him to
lecturing him, and liked to enter upon higher
themes with him, which he is so well fitted to
discuss, that he has become more contented, and
has resolved to accept his position. Let us speak
to him; notice how his eye brightens and his
expression changes, as he speaks.</p>

<p>“Well, King, how are your men to-day?”</p>

<p>“I’ve just been waiting for you, Miss &mdash;&mdash;; Joe
sent me to ask you for two of those hand-splints
you received yesterday&mdash;for the left hand, please&mdash;they
are for Jarvis and Wright&mdash;those very bad
arms, you know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh! yes. The splints that came with all those
things, yesterday, from the Sanitary Commission.
God bless that Sanitary Commission&mdash;what should
we do without it? Our soldiers here have quite as
much reason to be grateful as those in the field.
Look at those shelves&mdash;all that wine, those jellies,
preserves, syrups, and pickles, came from them, as
well as these cushions, pads, and splints. They
send us, constantly, fresh eggs, butter, lard, and
such perishable articles as must be consumed at
once. Here, King, take these splints, and then
come back, will you, for some pickles I want to
send to your men.”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am, certainly, if I can get down again;
but Joe is going away on a furlough, to-day, and I
am to be wardmaster till his return.”</p>

<p>“Shall your ‘blood boil’ more, or less, King, in
your new position?”</p>

<p>Do you hear that merry laugh, as he goes up the
stairs? No more fear for him; he is only making
himself too useful, and we shall be sorry to see
him returned to his regiment. Very tired, are
you, of the study of character? I have about a
dozen more men here that I should like to show
you, but I will be merciful, and send you home,
now, quite aware that you feel amply satisfied
with your hospital diet to-day.</p>

<h2 id="OUR_GETTYSBURG_MEN">OUR GETTYSBURG MEN.</h2>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">July</span>, 1863.</p>

<p>It is with peculiar feelings of gratitude, joy,
relief, and safety, that we have entered upon our
duties this week. The one absorbing idea of the
last ten days&mdash;the impatience for the news of each
hour as it passed&mdash;the eagerness to seek the opinions
of friends, even though such opinions brought
but further disturbance of mind&mdash;the difficulty
of deciding upon the proper course of action&mdash;the
heavy, wearing anxiety&mdash;the slow realization
that war, which we have, as yet, only looked upon
at a distance, might, at a moment, be brought to
our own doors,&mdash;our homes laid waste, and ourselves
fugitives&mdash;all these things live too freshly
in the minds of us all, to need word of mine to
recall them. Who can ever forget the pressure
which weighed down our spirits when we rose on
that most memorable “Fourth” just passed?&mdash;the
earnestness with which our cry to heaven went up
for success to our arms&mdash;the pause of those long
morning hours, when the whole city seemed holding
its breath in terrible suspense&mdash;and then the
grand, the glorious reaction, when the lightning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
flashed peace and joy and safety to all hearts?
Did ever language bring more joy than those
two blessed words, “Meade victorious?” What
could we do but fall upon our knees, and offer
up our hearts in thankfulness for such an answer
to our prayers? God did that day “take the
cause into his own hands, and judge between us
and our enemies,” and we were saved. Was it not
that, as a people, we had turned to him&mdash;as a
people we had acknowledged the weakness of a
human arm&mdash;as a people we had poured forth our
hearts in prayer, and he had heard us?</p>

<p>Those were indeed never-to-be-forgotten days.
Amid all other trials, came the sad thought of our
poor, wounded men at home. What would be their
fate? To leave them for the sake of personal
safety seemed so base; martyrdom for and with
them so attractive,&mdash;and yet it was not quite clear
to my mind&mdash;much as I longed to aid them&mdash;what
special benefit could accrue to them by self immolation
on the rebel altar. It was a difficult question;
and yet one always found payment for those anxious
hours, in listening to the earnest promises of
protection and defence&mdash;so evidently sincere&mdash;from
those warm hearts; the wish and purpose so far
outstripping the ability.</p>

<p>“Don’t you fear, ladies, we’ll take care of you.”</p>

<p>“We’ll fight for you while there’s a man of us
left.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, that we will! or a drop of blood left in
our bodies.”</p>

<p>“We’ll make earthworks of our bodies before the
rebs shall touch you, ladies, depend upon that.”</p>

<p>“Only protect yourselves,” said I, to a particularly
valiant cripple, who had just expressed similar
views for us, and slightly derogatory ones to the
rebel general, then supposed to be approaching our
city, “only protect yourselves, and I shall be quite
satisfied.”</p>

<p>“Protect ourselves!” said a poor fellow unable
to move in his bed; “they’ll make mince-meat of
us, the first thing.”</p>

<p>I found that this “mince-meat” idea took more
firm possession of my mind than almost any other
connected with the raid; and one of the greatest
reliefs which I experienced on that joyful day, was
the consciousness that it could not now be put into
execution.</p>

<p>The afternoon of the “Fourth,” as I entered the
hospital, the beaming faces and glad congratulations
of the poor fellows, proved how much they
had dreaded the rebel invasion, in spite of the bold
front which they had all presented, with the single
exception of my “mince-meat” friend. I still
recall, with pleasure, the intense delight of one
man to whom I spoke of our victory. By some
strange chance, which I never could explain, he
had not heard it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>“Is that so? Is it really so? That’s bully.
Let’s do something!” and, nothing else being at
hand, he seized his pillow and sent it high into
the air.</p>

<p>But now come the sad results, which must follow
alike in the wake of victory or defeat. The wounded,
where are they? A battle on our own soil, and at
so short a distance from us, comparatively speaking,
must bring them to us more directly from the field
than any we have yet received; and we have been
hoping all this week, as they were pouring into the
city, that we should have our share.</p>

<p>“Hoping?” Yes, hoping; start not at the term,
I have used it deliberately. Once launched upon
the sea of hospital life, your views undergo a
change, and your one interest becomes to receive,
nurse, and watch the worst cases; it is the hospital
spirit, and you cannot breathe its air without imbibing
the feeling. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday, Friday have passed, with only the admittance
of a few each day, none badly wounded,
and none requiring special care or tending; and to
those whose burning zeal makes them eager to pay
off some part of their debt of gratitude to men,
who, humanly speaking, have turned the enemy
from their doors, this is somewhat of a disappointment.
We have had, to be sure, the pleasure of
several visits from old friends here, who had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
slightly wounded in the fight, and have been
returned to other hospitals.</p>

<p>It is Saturday afternoon. I have just seated
myself in our room for a moment’s quiet, after a
most busy, bustling day,&mdash;many sick, and much to
do, although not exactly what we had wished for.
M. rushes in, on her return from her dinner.</p>

<p>“Sitting quietly, I declare, as if nothing was
going on! Do you know what’s at the door?”</p>

<p>“Nothing different from usual, I presume; you
needn’t try to excite me; I’ve just taken a seat
for a five minutes’ rest.”</p>

<p>“Go and look for yourself, then, if you are so
incredulous. Ambulances and stretchers enough,
I should think, to suit even your taste.”</p>

<p>As I hurry, half doubting, to the door, I meet
one of our surgeons, paper and pencil in hand,
talking to one of the wardmasters.</p>

<p>“How many beds in your ward? All ready, did
you say? That’s right.”</p>

<p>“Plenty of work for the ladies, Miss &mdash;&mdash;; I see
some pretty bad cases coming in.”</p>

<p>“Just what we wanted, doctor; we have been
hoping they would come in our week, and it’s
almost over.”</p>

<p>“Time enough, yet, to make them plenty of
milk punch, and cold drinks. Some of them, I
notice, are much exhausted, and will need stimulating.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>Here was a practical suggestion&mdash;something to
be acted upon at once, and far more useful than
running to look at them, as they are carried in;
so I return quickly, tell M. the doctor’s wish, and
all our pitchers are hastily filled with milk punch,
iced lemonade, syrup and water, etc., etc. This, of
course, occupies some little time; and as we reach
the dining-room,&mdash;where all are placed who can
walk, hobble, or crawl, till they are distributed
into the different wards, while those on stretchers
are being carried at once to their beds,&mdash;I almost
start at the rough-looking set we suddenly find
ourselves in the midst of. Are they miners or
coal-heavers? Black enough and dirty enough
for either; and I catch myself repeating over and
over, “In poverty, hunger, and dirt,” etc., till I
am afraid I shall say it aloud. But what care we
for dust and dirt? Set down your pitcher, shake
hands, and thank them. Is it not Gettysburg dust
and dirt? Is it not the dust and dirt of victory?
Have not those torn and bullet-riddled clothes
come straight from the field of their fame? And
have they not saved us from distress, wretchedness,
and ruin? I look at them with reverence; they
seem to bring the battle so very near that the tears
will rise, as those torn and dirty bandages show at
what cost the victory was won. But do not imagine
me standing all this time in a fine frenzy, meditating
on the results of a battle. These thoughts slip in,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
between the filling and emptying of our pitchers,
and the glad, grateful expressions for the “treat,”
as they call it. Poor fellows! they shall have our
best, that is very certain.</p>

<p>As I am pouring out the last glass from my
pitcher, my eye is caught by a face, on a stretcher,
as it is borne past me. It is that of a boy, scarcely
more than sixteen, I should think. His thick, black
curls, eyes bright and sparkling, (with fever, it
must be,) and brilliant color, contrast with his
remarkably clean shirt and sheet. What can it
mean, amidst this mass of dirt? As my work is
done, I follow him into the ward.</p>

<p>“You can’t have been in the Gettysburg fight,
my boy, were you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, ma’am, rightly, whether you’d
call it in it or not; I was in an ambulance, in the
rear. I’ve been in one, following the army, since
the twenty-first of June; and it seems pretty good
to be on a thing that don’t move.”</p>

<p>“But why weren’t you left in a hospital?”</p>

<p>“’Cause I begged so to go on with the rest. The
ambulance was going, and I begged them to let me
go in it, and I promised to be well for the fight; so
they took me; but I got so much worse, I didn’t
know when the fight was; it’s the typhoid I’ve
got, and my head’s dreadful bad.”</p>

<p>“Your hair is so heavy,” said I; “we’ll take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
some of that off and bathe your head, and that
will relieve it.”</p>

<p>“Oh! no, ma’am; no, thank you; I don’t want
it off.”</p>

<p>“Why not? It would be much cooler, and do
you good.”</p>

<p>“Why, I’ll soon be well, and it looks so pretty
when it’s fixed!”</p>

<p>The time has come, since then, when I have
quite agreed with David; those curls do look
very “pretty, when they’re fixed;” and I am
glad he pleaded for them so innocently. Let no
one ever say that vanity is confined to the breast
of woman; the result of close observation has
convinced me that it lives and thrives with tenfold
greater power in man; and this little proof of it,
just uttered with so much simplicity, only confirms
a preconceived opinion. I do not, however, confide
these views to my new friend, but advising
him to keep perfectly still, I say goodbye, for the
present, and pass on. As I hurry down the ward,
I am struck by the expression of utter contentment
and quiet, on a strange face&mdash;one of the new men,
evidently; as I come up to the bed where he is
lying, he seems to me to be actually <em>purring</em> with
satisfaction.</p>

<p>“You look as if you were comfortable, my friend,”
said I, “even though you are not very clean.”</p>

<p>“Oh! the blessing of this bed. If you could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
know, ma’am, what it was to have been marching
twenty miles, whether you could or not, again and
again, you’d soon feel what it was to be put on a
bed and let to stay there. Like the South, ma’am,
I just want ‘to be let alone;’ I don’t the least care
whether I’m clean or dirty&mdash;I’m lying quiet, and I
am happy.”</p>

<p>“Well, after a bath and clean clothes, which
they are giving the men as rapidly as possible,
you shall lie as still as you please; but I am afraid
that must come first.”</p>

<p>“Don’t think, ma’am,” said he, laughing, “that
I object to either of those things; they’ve not been
too plenty where we were, but I just feel now as if
I never wanted to move again.”</p>

<p>“I can easily understand your feeling; enjoy
your quiet as long as they will let you, and I will
bring you some supper, later.”</p>

<p>I left him and hurried over to our room, where
I found M. busily employed, and hastened to take
my share in the work. Just at this moment, as
we were flying about in every direction, now here,
now there, with a pad for one, a basin and sponge
to wet wounds for another, cologne for a third, and
milk punch for a fourth, I felt Dick (our hospital
dog, my faithful friend and ally, a four-footed
Vidocq, in his mode of scenting out grievances,)
seize my dress in his teeth, pull it hard, and look
eagerly up in my face. “What is it, Dick? I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
too busy to attend to you just now.” Another
hard pull, and a beseeching look in his eyes.
“Presently, my fine fellow! presently. Gettysburg
men must come first.”</p>

<p>He wags his tail furiously, and still pulls my
dress. Does he mean that he wants me for one
of them? Perhaps so. “Come, Dick, I’ll go with
you.” He starts off delighted, leads me to the
ward where those worst wounded have been placed,
travels the whole length of it to the upper corner,
where lies a man apparently badly wounded, and
crying like a child. I had seen him brought in on
a stretcher, but in the confusion had not noticed
where he had been taken. Dick halted, as we
arrived at the bed, looked at me, as much as to
say, “There, isn’t that a case requiring attention?”
and then, as though quite satisfied to resign him
into my hands, trotted quietly off.</p>

<p>I stood a moment to take an observation&mdash;to
make a sort of moral diagnosis before beginning
my attack&mdash;to find out whether the man needed
direct or indirect sympathy. Very often, to a
severely wounded man&mdash;not of a nervous temperament,
but suffering intensely,&mdash;a kind word, showing
that you appreciate and enter into that suffering,
falls on the burning wound with a soothing,
cooling power, as beneficial, for the instant, as a
more visible application; on the wound, I say, for
the answer is, after a few minutes’ conversation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
not, “Thank you, I feel better able to bear the
pain, now;” but, “Thank you, my arm doesn’t
burn as much as it did&mdash;my limb isn’t so painful&mdash;my
head feels cooler, now.” But, on the other
hand, who that has suffered from unstrung nerves
does not know that what is most needed in such a
case, is to divert the mind from itself&mdash;to present
suddenly some other image powerful enough to
efface from it the impressions of its own wretched
self&mdash;to enable it to rouse itself and rise above the
weakness it is ashamed of, but has no power to
conquer? Any allusion to the suffering itself, in
such a case, only adds fuel to the flame.</p>

<p>I had time to draw my own conclusions, and soon
decided that Dick’s protegé belonged to this latter
class. He did not notice my approach; I therefore
stood watching him for a little while. His arm
and hand, from which the bandage had partially
slipped, were terribly swollen; the wound was in
the wrist, (or rather, as I afterwards found, the
ball had entered the palm of his hand and had
come out at his wrist,) and appeared to be, as it
subsequently proved, a very severe one.</p>

<p>My boast that I could make a pretty good conjecture
what State a man came from by looking at
him, did not avail me here. I was utterly at fault.
His fair, Saxon face, so far as I could judge of it
as he lay sobbing on his pillow, had something
feminine&mdash;almost childlike&mdash;in the innocence and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
gentleness of its expression; and my first thought
was one which has constantly recurred on closer
acquaintance, “How utterly unfit for a soldier!”
He wanted the quick, nervous energy of the New
Englander, who, even when badly wounded, rarely
fails to betray his origin; he had none of the rough
off-hand dash of our Western brothers, and could
never have had it, even in health; nor yet the
stolidity of our Pennsylvania Germans. No! it
was clear that I must wait till he chose to enlighten
me as to his home. After a few minutes’ study, I
was convinced that his tears were not from the
pain of his wound; there was no contraction of
the brow, no tension of the muscles, no quivering
of the frame; he seemed simply very weary, very
languid, like a tired child, and I resolved to act
accordingly.</p>

<p>“I have been so busy with our defenders, this
afternoon,” said I, “that I have had no time to
come and thank you.”</p>

<p>He started, raised his tear-stained face, and said,
with a wondering air, “To thank me? For what?”</p>

<p>“For what?” said I; “haven’t you been keeping
the rebels away from us? Don’t you know that if
it hadn’t been for you and many like you, we might
at this moment have been flying from our homes,
and General Lee and his men occupying our city?
You don’t seem to know how grateful we are to
you&mdash;we feel as though we could never do enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
for our brave Gettysburg men to return what they
have done for us.”</p>

<p>This seemed quite a novel idea, and the tears
were stopped to muse upon it.</p>

<p>“We tried to do our duty, ma’am, I know that.”</p>

<p>“I know it too, and I think I could make a
pretty good guess what corps you belong to. Suppose
I try. Wasn’t it the Second Corps? You
look to me like one of General Hancock’s men;
you know they were praised in the papers for
their bravery. Am I right?”</p>

<p>The poor tired face brightened instantly. The
random shot had hit the mark.</p>

<p>“Yes, Second Corps. Did you know by my
cap?”</p>

<p>“Your cap? You don’t wear your cap in bed,
do you? I haven’t seen your cap; I guessed by
that wound&mdash;it must have been made where there
was pretty hard fighting, and I knew the Second
Corps had done their share of that.”</p>

<p>But this was dangerous ground, as I felt the
moment the allusion to his wound was made; the
sympathy was too direct, and his eyes filled at
once. Seeing my mistake, I plunged off rapidly
on another tack.</p>

<p>“Did you notice my assistant orderly who came
in with me just now? He had been over to see
you before, for he came and told me you wanted
me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>“I wanted you! No, ma’am; that’s a mistake;
no one’s been near me since they bathed me, and
gave me clean clothes&mdash;I know there hasn’t, for I
watched them running all about; but none came
to me, and I want so much to have my arm dressed.”
And the ready tears once more began to flow.</p>

<p>“There is no mistake. I told you that my assistant
orderly came to me in the ladies’ room, and
told me that you needed me. Think again&mdash;who
has been here since you were brought in?”</p>

<p>“Not a single soul, ma’am,&mdash;indeed, not a thing,
but a dog, standing looking in my face, and wagging
his tail, as if he was pitying me.”</p>

<p>“But a dog! Exactly; he’s my assistant orderly;
he came over to me, pulled my dress, and wouldn’t
rest till I came to see after you. I am surprised
you speak so slightingly of poor Dick.”</p>

<p>Here was at once a safe and fertile theme. I
entered at large upon Dick’s merits; his fondness
for the men&mdash;his greater fondness, occasionally,
for their dinners&mdash;his having made way with three
lunches just prepared for men who were starting&mdash;(the
result, probably, of having heard the old story
that the surgeons eat what is intended for the men,)
our finding him one day on our table with his head
in a pitcher of lemonade, and how I had tried to
explain to him that such was not the best way of
proving his regard for his friends, the soldiers, but
I feared without much effect&mdash;in short, I made a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
long story out of nothing, till the wardmaster
arrived with his supper, saying that the doctor’s
orders were that the new cases should all take
something to eat before he examined their wounds.
My friend had quite forgotten his own troubles in
listening to Dick’s varied talents, and allowed me
to give him his supper very quietly, as I found he
was really too much exhausted even to raise his
uninjured arm to his mouth. I had the pleasure
of seeing him smile for goodbye, and having given
him rather more time than I could spare, hurried
away, with a promise of seeing him the next day
(Sunday), for they were too ill not to be watched.</p>

<p>But oh! for a little more daylight! It is getting
so dark, and yet I must stop and make acquaintance
with each new face&mdash;or rather, I long to do
so, but it will not be possible. Look at those clear
blue eyes, over there&mdash;just what the French call
“les yeux de velours!”&mdash;I cannot surely pass them
without a word; they smile a welcome as I approach.
What a contrast their owner presents to poor Stillwell,
my tearful friend, whom I have just left. A
sweet, bright face, clear complexion, curling light
hair, and something very winning in his open,
frank expression, which attracts you to him at
once. Before he opens his lips I am persuaded
that he possesses a cheerful spirit, ready to look
on the bright side of everything.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>“You don’t look as though you were suffering
much; I hope you’re not badly wounded.”</p>

<p>What a beaming, beautiful smile, as he extends
his hand to me at once!</p>

<p>“Oh! no; not badly, only hit in the shoulder;
it’s pretty painful, but I guess I’ll be all right in a
few days.”</p>

<p>How little could I imagine, from his words, what
I found out a few days later, that I was standing
at that moment by one of the very worst wounds
that had come in. The surgeon of the ward told
me that he considered it a most critical case, and
that, had the shot gone one half inch further, it
must have been certainly fatal. It seemed that
Dick and I between us, had discovered the two
most severely wounded men in the whole hospital.
For many weeks after that they were dangerously
ill, requiring close and careful watching every hour,
but rewarding us in the end with the hope of perfect
recovery.</p>

<p>“I am glad to hear it,” said I, in answer to his
too sanguine view of his wound, “for you don’t
look as if you had seen much sickness, and maybe
you wouldn’t bear it very well.”</p>

<p>“I’ve never been a day in bed in my life before
this, and I hardly know what to make of it. I’m
an Ohio boy, used to the country and living in the
open air, and I couldn’t stand being shut up here
at all; it’s as bad as the Libby prison.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>Fancy my horror. Our hospital compared to the
Libby prison!</p>

<p>“Oh! you mustn’t say that; we try to do everything
here to make the confinement as easy as
possible to the men, and to help them to forget
that it is a hospital. I’m sure you can’t have
been in the ‘Libby’ ever, have you?”</p>

<p>“Oh! no, indeed, never; but it seems just as
bad to me to be fastened in here.”</p>

<p>“Well, some day, soon, I will bring you in some
of our men who have been there; let them talk to
you and give you their experience, and then, when
you know us better, I will ask you whether you
still think the same. But now I must really say
good-night. I will come to the ‘prison,’ to-morrow,
to see how you all are.”</p>

<p>“Thank you; you’ll be very welcome; and
maybe,” added he, laughing, “it won’t seem so
like it when I get at home here;” and once more
extending his hand, he said “good-night.”</p>

<p>So ended the memorable week of July, 1863,
which followed the glorious Gettysburg fight.</p>

<p>The tide of war has rolled back from our homes;
the highly strung nerves are calmed; the dead
sleep in the quiet graves which a people’s love has
provided for them on the field of their fame; the
wounded, so lately massed in our midst, are scattered;
some&mdash;too few, alas!&mdash;returned, cured, to
their regiments; others (the saddest part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
war) discharged from service, disabled and crippled
for life; while for the remainder, listen to the
words of that pale boy&mdash;as I raise his head to
give him the needed stimulant, the notes of music
fall on my ear.</p>

<p>“What is that, Henry?”</p>

<p>“What is that, do you ask, Miss &mdash;&mdash;? That is
only some of our poor Gettysburg boys <em>going home</em>;”
and I recognize the dead march, and I see the
reversed arms, as the mournful train winds by.</p>

<p>Time has gone on; new faces, new forms, have
filled the places of the old ones, and still our labors,
our hopes, our Prayers, continue for our dear and
bleeding country; still continues, also, our abiding
faith and trust in the ultimate triumph of the right;
and, leaving the event in Higher Hands, fearlessly
we abide the issue.</p>

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
